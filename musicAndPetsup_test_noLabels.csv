With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."

"1042","","","B0045F9WWS","be4edae88f523c6a2ae48376fde792280IA6","Dimitri Mitropoulos was a superb conductor who has been somewhat forgotten nowadays. He led the NYPO for several years from the late 40's to the late 50's, with the great Leonard Bernstein following him. Mitropoulos had a brilliant way of conducting modern music that wasn't heard too often back then, with a conducting style that was once compared to a ""Byzantine monk furiously shaking martinis"". One of the composers he excelled in was Gustav Mahler, back when Mahler was rarely heard. This is a live performance of the ""Tragic"" sixth symphony from April 10th, 1955. It is very, very, good, if a bit flawed in a few places. For one thing, the sound quality is surprisingly good for a live recording from the mid 50's. But, there is a patch of some kind of electrical hiss or whirl in the fourth movement. Maybe it's the download or it's the original recording, but it's very annoying. Fortunately, it only lasts about 2 or 3 minutes. The audience is not too intrusive with coughing and such.\n  As for the actual performance, it's fantastic. The work moves at a nice pace and sounds like the sixth should at almost all the right spots. The second and third movements are presented as andante followed by the scherzo. You know, one way you can always tell a true Mahler fan apart is to ask them the question ""Which do you prefer, scherzo before andante, or andante before scherzo?"" A true fan will know just what you mean, and then be emphatic on their opinion of the order of those movements. I have always preferred the Scherzo before the andante, perhaps because that's the way I first heard the symphony. You know what they say about first impressions. Plus, I feel IMHO that you need that long, beautiful andante to come before the nearly 30 minute finale. The metabolism, or ""Blood Pressure"" if you will, of the work needs to slow and calm down in order to prepare both you and itself for that finale. Could you imagine Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the molto vivace scherzo coming right before the Ode to Joy finale, and not the slow movenent? The same goes for Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 or Mahler's Fourth. Now I can't damn the performance or recording because of this. It's a personal preference, and of course andante before scherzo does work for a lot of Mahlerites.\n  In the end, this recording is for die-hard Mahler fans. Or die-hard Mitropoulos fans. If you want a good first recording of the sixth, try Pierre Boulez and the VPO on DG, which is the best version I've ever heard. George Szell also does great version with the Cleveland Orchestra, now out of print I think. As for Bernstein, the second version, on DG from the 80's is also a must have.--------------PEACE"
"1044","","","B0045F9WWS","4d9f27fd24d51c5baf75a02075e4b4adM7EL","Previous reviewers have already covered the obvious merits of this live performance and broadly agree except perhaps regarding the extent to which the NYPO plays accurately. I have to say that apart from a few minor burbles from the trumpet and horns which remain perfectly acceptable in a live, I am amazed by the unanimity of their drive and attack; Mitropoulos galvanises them into giving a truly ferocious account of the stretti passages in the first and final movements and they are very sharp in following both the conductor's beat and the frequent switches in rhythm and time signatures characteristic of Mahler's scores. It is clear that Bernstein by no means had it all to do in familiarising this orchestra with Mahler in the sixties; his mentor had obviously already rained and enthused them.\n\nThe only reason to regret the slightly raw and quite resonant mono sound is in the huge, tutti climaxes of the finale, when Mitropoulos generates an extraordinarily glorious cacaphony as the titanic struggle between optimism and despair unfolds; otherwise the acoustic, by accentuating the typically strident whistle of the violins when they are playing high up on the bridge, if anything, adds to the excitement. However, Mitropoulos knows when to let the music swoon and sigh and again prompts me to wonder just how influential he was in informing Bernstein's own style in Mahler.\n\nThere is some radio whistle a few minutes into that finale and the audience are a bit restive up top that point, too, but both irritations pass and Mitropoulos keeps the screws on to the bitter end - and indeed it is, deeply dark and forlorn.\n\nI have an entirely irrelevant and personal reason for favouring this recording; it happens to have been made on the same Easter Sunday over sixty years ago when I first saw the light of day..."

In 1965 alone they had six Top 10 singles (including two No. 1's) and sold millions of records, rivaling The Beatles for chart dominance.\n\nGranted, this music isn't quantum physics, but songs like ""I'm Into Something Good,"" ""Silhouettes"" and ""Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" were infectious ear candy for those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties. One of the first six albums I bought (I now have over 7,000) was INTRODUCING HERMAN'S HERMITS with the three previously mentioned singles on it. It also contained a lot of covers like ""Sea Cruise"" and ""I Understand,"" but this was a singles band which is what makes this such a terrific collection. The only singles missing are their last two to chart in the U.S.--""Don't Go Out Into the Rain (You're Going To Melt)"" and ""Museum,"" both from 1967.\n\nInstead we're given a handful of failed US singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although several of them hit the top ten in the UK.  Since this is, after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of package. [Note: No. 1 songs like ""Mrs. Brown"" and ""I'm Henry VIII, I Am"" are on this set, too, even though they were never released in the UK as singles. So this collection seems to be a compromise for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.]\n\nHere is the complete track listing:\n\n1. I'm Into Something Good (US #13, UK #1)\n2. Show Me Girl (UK #19)\n3. Silhouettes (US #5, UK #3)\n4. Can't You Hear My Hearbeat ((US #2)\n5. Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (US #1)\n6. Wonderful World (US #4, UK #7)\n7. I'm Henry VIII, I Am (US #1)\n8.

Lady Barbara (UK #13) [Note: Their final UK single, 1970]\n\nThe skimpy four-page booklet provides a brief history of the band, only one photo (the cover shot--minus Karl Greene), and a track listing that includes the songwriter and year of release. The CD label says ""stereo,"" but there is no mention of remastering.\n\nLast summer, I saw Peter Noone and a touring version of the Hermits (no original members) at a free concert. It was great fun to listen to him sing the old hits, and this generous 25-track compilation provides a nastolgic trip down memory lane. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [Running time - 65:38]"

Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.\n\nSong: D+"

I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere. One thing to keep in mind; this is a compilation and I found that I already have some of the songs on the full album, so I would suggest going through the samples and checking that you don't already have some of the songs."

This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks."

The song reminds us that what's really important is to know the one you love and not be swayed by what others might think.\n\nHer delivery is clear and draws you in with its sincerity and passion. That is what makes her a true talent: Conya Doss makes you FEEL...and isn't that what we want from any artist?\n\nDON'T CHANGE is an anthem for anyone who has found someone that is comfortable in their own skin.

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

Since I found this song on the free list, I was most impressed with the singing of Peter Bradley Adams. In fact, I am going to search for more of his songs.\n\nThis song is sung with much heart and soul and I love how it is performed, upbeat yet mellow!\n\nHighly recommend this song."

The thing is, though, THE SEER is not equally superb throughout.  The second disc is just amazing, so don't be too hasty to form your opinion after only hearing Disc One.  The opening track (Lunacy) is fairly light, and there is a clear minimalist influence.  Then Disc Two shoots us screaming into space on a dark, psychedelic voyage!\n\nMichael Gira's reformed Swans are more powerful than ever.  The more recent TO BE KIND (2014) is more consistent than THE SEER -- it's stronger throughout -- but it does not reach the same heights.\n\nThe music of Michael Gira and Swans is raw, visionary and uncompromising.  His vocals remind of both Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, but the music is sui generis.  Listening is like plugging your mind directly into the black hole at the heart of the galaxy."

The opener ""Farewell"" with David Cullen's electric guitar is breathtakingly moving.  On the second track ""World Without End,"" Eugene Friesen's cello gives such depth in counterpoint to Heidi's gorgeous piano melody.  ""Eight steps free"" is another delightful track that opens with the lyricon (sounds like a penny whistle to me); it's ethereal and beautiful.  Janis Ian penned ""Tea & Sympathy"" that was on her 1975 album ""Between the Lines"" which transforms under Heidi's touch into a soft lullaby with her gentle vocals hugging the lovely melody.  ""Moondancing"" is a lovely soft piece that is given a major jazz inflection with Premik Russell-Tubbs' saxophone.  ""Beyond the Turning"" works well as a largely new age instrumental offering because of the great variety in instruments, superb musicianship and Heidi's inspired performance.  Enjoy!"

Musically, he was one of the most influential entertainers of all time. But after the 80's and early 90's, Michael was losing his seat from the throne, and in 2009, he passed away. But he had some of the most brilliant songs during his peak of his success, and that will never be taken away from what he left behind. When the pressure was on to follow-up the mammoth success of Thriller, Bad didn't have the sales success in the long run, but Michael still had the chart success and some of the most timeless songs of his career, in fact more timeless than even Thriller, Off The Wall, or what he had with his brothers in the Jackson 5. Man In The Mirror remains one of Michael's most riveting ballad of the 80's, that still has as much serious heart reflecting on the negative world around us, and how differences can be made for a better life for everyone. It still is one of Michael Jackson's deepest ballads that is worth listening to each and every time. If you have never even heard a Michael Jackson song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: B+"

That solid message gets muddied up and diluted through a series of execution errors.  The end result is the message is getting lost in the translation to music.  The music itself has an overall ethereal and trance-like quality.  It pulses with a repetitive, ""mamamamama,"" that quickly begins grating on the listener's ears.  Luckily, it stops just about the time you can't take it anymore.\n\nThis song is very unusual.  I downloaded it for free, and will listen to it again when I'm in the kind of mood when I want to veg out and let the sound waves wash over me, but I'm mostly relieved that I didn't pay for it.  Maybe it will grow on me.  If it does, I'll update my review.  For now, it's only okay."

"8803","","","B00BJ6C5Q6","20cab76c4daf87b36f7c57be518e2ce56ABF","One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era.  In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him.  He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit.  Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list.  With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement.  Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute.  Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute.  And it is a virtuosic display.  Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune.  As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending.  A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato.  Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major.  Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro.  Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only.  Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts.  But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom.  Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail.  Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support.  Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere.  One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death.  While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn."

With the shocking and deviating news that David Bowie had a battle with cancer, I was deeply shocked not only because he was a great innovator in art, he was a brilliant musician, whether it was through Alladian Sane, Let's Dance, or with songs like Under Pressure with Queen and China Girl. The guy was sincerely amazing. One of his last songs, showed a intimate side from his music that really showed he was still standing, after a decade-long absence from making music. Where Are We Now?, which David recorded from his 2013 album, The Last Day really showed a deepness in his music, and a brilliance in his own heart to where he was returning. The song was proof he really had, where everyone else through him off. This is a great reminder of what David showed for years in his work from fashion, art, and and sincere love for music. Rest In Peace, Rock & Roll Chameleon.\n\nDavid Bowie 1947-2016\n\nSong: B+"

But every once in a while a great songwriter has had a song that is alright, but not anything to rave about. Made To Love, the third single from his album Love In The Future, is alright but it doesn't actually ignite to the best that matches with his other tracks from the album like Who Do We Think We Are and All Of Me had shown.

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those singers that has been more like a manufactured product than a real songstress. It is sad that when she came out with her surprise record, she honestly could not even come close to holding a a note from the heart in her work. It is sad that she hasn't found the right songs either, whether it was Drunk In Love with Jay-Z, Pretty Hurts, or her single Flawless with Chimamanda. The song is definitely a waste of her heart, and sounds seemly too familiar like her earlier songs like Diva. Overall, I definitely found this song to lag the talent she had from her earlier work, and her days with Destiny's Child. Overall, if she keeps making songs that are terrible like this, than I think she should honestly retire from music period. Beyonce' Knowles is not flawless, just flawed.\n\nSong: D+"

Unfortunately for Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more overexposed as a product than looked at more seriously as a diva. Sadly, she has been more oversaturated than most other female singers, and the quality of her own voice has been weak than strong with each and every album she has made. When it has came out to they hype around her self-titled album, as a surprise release, she unfortunately has made music that has been weaker with each and every note. Pretty Hurts didn't actually ignite as one of those singles that didn't actually shine.

The categories are even more varied if you count the second release which includes contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You) and some old school 80s rock (Phil Collins In the Air Tonight).  There are ten songs over two releases and this first release accounts for six of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.  My favorite of this lot would be their cover of Metallicas Nothing Else Matters wherein Smith soars to add that emotional punch right at the right moment."

I Wish, the second single from their album Love, Marriage & Divorce isn't a bad ballad that shows the elegance of the piano through Toni's voice. While it does feel a bit corny through some of the lyrics of the songs, but nevertheless Toni does deliver through the song well through Babyface's piano playing. Still Toni is a much better singer than the idiots female singers of today like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, who have not shown beauty in voice through the song alone.

It won't wake you up if you are trying to stay awake, nor will it put you to sleep either (although more toward feeling relaxed than anything).  I listened to other songs by this singer, and this is by far the best.  Take a listen but don't expect miracles."

In this considerable gap of time, the guys have kept busy doing various, individual side albums, collaborations, and other projects. Apparently the timeout must have inspired member appreciation of how valuable their combined chemistry really is because this 2014 Directors Of Photography album ranks equally with any one of their previous albums, which set a more ambitious standard for conscious hip hop with each consecutive release. The hallowed LA triumvirate are essentially back to their specialty, kicking tight, crafty hip hop rhymes and lyrics over elegant, soulful beats that are expertly put together, samples included. Fans can look forward to more life lessons on which to ponder and more unique attitudes, opinions, perspectives and philosophies to consider. In addition to the mental, metaphysical goodies on the album, Rakaa and Evidence also dabble in some tough-talk rapping, which means they believe in what they're saying, they are not speaking on some loose whim, and they can back up their words with strong reasoning. Every track on the album is a gem, but a few really stand out. ""Show Me The Way"" sounds like it could be a radio song. It's motivational, and it's got a great beat, a great hook, and great lyrics behind it. ""Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)"" is notable for its screwed, scratched beat, which sounds like the old East Coast-influenced West meets DJ Screw's Houston, a great hip hop cut. The gang are not without worldly awareness in ""Century Of The Self"" where they analyze the corrupt, selfish tendencies of human nature on earth. The Dilated Peoples have always been proponents of building mentally and expanding minds. They have always come original and never copied trends or tried to be something other than themselves. Directors Of Photography is all those things at once, and as a result, everyone wins."

Their songs have honestly made them feel more wasted than strong in the voice alone. When Jhene Aiko came out a year ago, I sincerely wasn't that appealed to her when her song The Worst came out and I really didn't find it to ignite, but she really has had a good sense of her voice to deliver in her music and her heart as well. Wading, the second track from her second album Souled Out works very well. She does deliver a hypnotic song in her heart, without feeling jaded at the end. It does follow up with what The Pressure did so well. It is a good song that works at the heart from her soul.

I applaud  Mary J Blige for taking a risk and doing something different. Her vocals are still rich and powerful. However, the song just does not resonate.

Jonathan Antoine's  crystal clear voice, his diction is perfect, the control and softness in his voice then the contrast of the crescendos which display the power and passion, and to be able to sing with this power, emotion and intensity at 19 yrs of age .. I find it astonishing.  Jonathan ""feels"" the emotion  and conveys it superbly.  The heartbreaking lyrics are so beautiful sung with such emotion by Jonathan  ..... I'd advise anyone who has 'loved and lost' to have a box of tissues nearby before listening to Track 8 on Tenore.\n  ""On broken wings my heart has taken flight, and left a dream ..... in my dream our lips are blending, will my dream be never ending .... will your memory haunt me till I die ..... alone am I .. deep into the night .. waiting for the light .....alone am I .. ......I wonder why ... deep is the night""  Breathtaking and hauntingly beautiful .."

"16469","","","B00SBR5608","4d1373613dabf727cedc8e2b4c6b5ea1ERCM","50 Cent's flagship team, G-Unit, is back after releasing 2014's The Beauty Of Independence EP, the group's first release since 2008's Terminate On Sight LP. Ironically, 50 hardly even appears on this The Beast Is G-Unit EP, aside from one: a wooing autotune bit opening the introductory ""Ballin,"" and two: the chorus of ""Boy Boy."" G-Unit's six year hiatus proved their best marketing tool for The Beauty Of Independence, which overall performed well. The guys were gallantly back on their gangsta schtick with some renewed and newfound spirit. The same is true for The Beast Is G-Unit, except this one suffers the fate of coming after Beauty.\n\nIn relation to before, the repetition in content includes the gangsterism, pimping, worship of big boy toys, and various other infractions of the law that the five-piece crew commit on this round's excursion. The mostly-complete gang of Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Kidd Kidd (50 Cent barely contributes) are satisfactorily lyrical for the most part, relegating their gifts to street life matters and proving to fans that they can still band-up after all these years. Notwithstanding that fact, Lloyd Banks, out of all the members, gives the EP the brightest signs of lyrical virtuosity, throwing in different rhythms and tempos and basically just showing the most free-spirited character of any in the bunch.\n\nAside from needing to be there and appealing to a new class of hip hop listeners, the beats walk a thin line between relevancy and redundancy, harnessing the nervous, temporal energy of drill- ticks and a few sounds from G-Unit's past, i.e., organ, wavering electric guitar and ringing piano. Although The Beast Is G-Unit is lyrically on par with anything from the group's past, it still remains skimpy on intelligent, advanced art, making the biggest impact by being stunning, shocking and thrilling as opposed to the aesthetic of being fascinating and intriguing from an intellectual standpoint."

Exactly what this album is, this album just made me a fan.\nFrom beginning to end I have played Southern Lights many times, which is rare nowadays. It is kind of somber (used Google to search for that word) meaning its not an album you get turnt to, but will appreciate the quality that Alex and Murray bring to you.\nHave you seen the mini movie? Oh yea, visual album, good move, like I said love pleasant surprises.\nGuys, please pay attention to WLAK, they are on to something."

"17281","","","B00VNAU3CG","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Fire in the Rainstorm"" is Kori Linae Carothers second project with Will Ackerman producing, and her first solo piano album. It is her fourth album to date and contains twelve original pieces. With one of the more dramatic album covers of the year, the music is both eloquent and beautiful, fueled by grace and passionate emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed Koris first recording with Ackerman, ""Trillium,"" but it is amazing the depth and honesty that is often revealed when an artist goes it alone with just the piano. Such is the case here. It is interesting to note from her bio, that Kori is deaf in one ear and was told as a child that she would never be a musician. She continued her music studies through high school and college, proving the naysayers to be completely wrong. In a way, she has come full circle and is now donating a percentage of the sales from ""Fire in the Rainstorm"" to Hearing Health Foundation.\n\nThe album opens with A Day Like No Other, a dreamy and slightly melancholy piece that also expresses determination and hope - a lovely way to begin. Flowing and lyrical, it grabbed my attention right away! Nunus Sunrise was composed as a loving tribute with warmth and strong emotions. Its really interesting how the piece starts to slow near the end and then just fades out, unresolved - kind of like life does sometimes. Meadow is a favorite with its relaxed, carefree mood and easy grace. Tidal Rift is a beautiful, heartfelt piece inspired by the ups and downs in relationships - another favorite. The title track is a passionate piece written for a friend whose life has been full of turbulence. The piece begins calmly, gradually building in intensity and drama - very powerful! The Day is a tribute to those who lost their lives on 9/11. Originally recorded as an electronic piece on Koris first album, ""The Road Less Traveled,"" its a poignant and tender piano solo - another favorite. The Kindly Beast is especially touching, knowing that Marvin, Koris beloved dog, died recently. He followed her everywhere and liked to get in the way of her hands when she was playing the piano (Ive had the same problem with my cats!). Marvins playful antics will live forever in this song. Whispers of the Heart is a stirring tribute to friends and family who stand by through lifes trials and joys. Buoyant yet deeply emotional, its a beauty! When the Trees Fell mourns the loss of a giant tree with five trunks that was taken down by a huge storm. Grief and loss flow throughout this gorgeous piece, ending the album with a sigh and a tear.\n\nKori Linae Carothers has really come into her own with ""Fire in the Rainstorm."" I hope it brings her the fans and recognition she so deserves! Very highly recommended!"

When I had heard so many songs, I can tell whether or not the sampled song works much better. That very rarely works, especially in R&B when artists like Maze or the great Whitney Houston whom did it very well, because they showed colors can be blossom in R&B. But in pop, that doesn't work so easily. When I first heard Halsey, it really didn't seem like it was anything special. Then, I went back to her music, after I heard one of her songs, which was sampled by Coldplay and Beyonce' for Hymn For The Weekend. Halsey's New Americana was the song they sampled, and listening to it, it was very dark but took a very tough stance on how the younger Americans have not been recognized for the past several years, and with people like Donald Trump whom made them look like there voices never existed. It isn't a bad song, but yet there are other ones that sounded much better taking a stance with he next generations in society around.\n\nSong: C 1/2+"

"18747","","","B017BBGFH2","9b351fe9c06e3d6df2683235d966b0a7LSAD","This release grew out of last years unexpectedly successful Renaissance Choral Music box, and our yearly Big Baroque Box. We moved further in time to the Baroque period - but we discovered that if we did a Big Baroque Choral Music Box, it would, generously put, be about 75 hours long (no exaggeration). But it is named as a follow up to the Renaissance Choral Box, so we can move into Volumes 3 and beyond (and we will). So we cut out for the time being Bach, Handel and Purcell, all composers who we have covered with their own individual boxes. And we still left out quite a bit.\n\nWhy did we leave hours and hours of recordings off of this box? Well, for this box, we wanted to focus on Bach Guild recordings that had been buried in the vault for a while. The two juicy nuggets in this box are a long-forgotten recording of Israel in Egypt - one of the first Bach Guild releases (BG 521 to save you the trip to your LP collection). Sung in German, this is a rare bit, and The Bach Guilds first recording of a Handel oratorio. The second juicy bit is a complete recording of Glucks Orfeo and Euridice, made in Vienna (one of the last Vanguard recordings made in Vienna) in the mid 1960s, with a superb cast and conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras (BG 686, stereo version BGS 70686). This was released on CD in the early 1990s but has been out of print for (we estimate) nearly 20 years.\n\nAlso getting their Bach Guild digital debuts are the wonderful recording of the Kraus Funeral Cantata for Gustav, the Charpentier Te Deum with Jean-Francois Paillard (with Maurice Andre playing trumpet in the famous opening movement) and several other Baroque choral and vocal works featuring Alfred Deller, Maureen Forrester and other well-beloved members of the Bach Guild roster.\n\nKudos to the executive producer of The Bach Guild for tireless work resurrecting the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus RV 594. We often have just bare threads of information on the older recordings, and hunting down the old LP (and this is the 11th LP The Bach Guild released) can be very difficult, although we do have an extensive library, we don't have everything. The information was sketchy and misleading, and we tried to include this recording in the Big Vivaldi Box but we really couldn't piece the work together. This time, we were able to locate a score and place the tracks in the proper order (the information we had actually indicates that this was a different Vivaldi Dixit (there are two). So this recording, probably out of print for 50 years is now featured, in all its glory. We cant confirm this, but this release probably represented the first complete recording of the RV 594. We put the release date as 1952 (original LP number: BG 678, in stereo as BG 70678 - we only had the mono master at our disposal).\n\nAnd snark aside, we meant glory as in loud and glorious. This collection does not feature any historically informed instrument-based performances. You will hear full-throated choirs, and the Vivaldi never gets performed like this in our era, so its a surprise and surprisingly beautiful to hear an operatic choir throw themselves into this work now essentially in the possession of much smaller early music groups (not that theres anything wrong with that, either way).\n\nAgain, theres a lot more we could have put inbut we tend to cap these at 10-12 hours (yikes). This one is 8 hours and 54 minutes. Thanks to all who contacted us for all the suggestions for repertoire in the past year."

Musically, it has been much harder to see one that will ignite afire in the way that groups like En Vogue and Destiny's Child had been able to do the past few generations. When Fifth Harmony came out the past few years, I honestly was not very thrilled at the songs that they had been able too come out with in heart and soul. I was not excited of the songs Sledgehammer and Worth It, which showed the gals were not very strong at the soul, and sounded more like they were little children at the mike for the first time than divas at the heart. Their latest single from their second album 7/27, tries to bring in more of a reggae feeling to their songs, but it didn't work overall. All In My Head (Flex) their latest single, doesn't actually deliver at the heart of the matter to what they really could've deliver, as a more sultry and seductive song to turn to the kids, into sultry songstresses. I really was not very impressed with the song, and hopefully, when the gals grow further into their music, Fifth Harmony will have much more down the road to sing about.\n\nSong: C-"

For Ariana Grande, she has been trying to mature into diva-hood like the ranks of divas from Mariah Carey to the great Whitney Houston (as her lackluster drive had shown on the ABC show Greatest Hits.) For Ariana, I was not very impressed with her lackluster songs already released from her Dangerous Woman album from Into You and Dangerous Woman. But also her song from last year, Focus didn't even shine her voice brighter, instead her voice sounded more shrill and putting too much emphasis on looking for herself, than a real voice. Her latest single, Let Me Love You, the third from her Dangerous Woman, isn't actually a striking duet. She and Lil' Wayne do not even have enough chemistry to sparkle on this track to shimmer as one of the more classic duets. Perhaps ariana has more growing up she has to do to make the heart firmly fonder. Maybe when she makes another record, it will work for her, but not now.\n\nSong: D+"

"501022","","","B0042AML1U","87b0fee496feb27d423f1d6c7ef900b5G3A5","I have tried using at least three styles of cat harness, and this is by far the best of the three, because of the easy to attach ""side release buckles"", one on each loop, for neck and chest. Unlike other designs, you do not have to slip loops over the front paws and you don't have to fasten the side release buckles under kitty's tummy, all the while kitty is not liking this operation one bit.\n\nI confess there is one drawback to the ever so simple looking side release buckles. That is, they are small. It's a snap (literally) to connect them. Disconnecting them is another story entirely. With my old, clumsy fingers, it often takes me several tries to be able to pinch the plastic prongs together just right to release the buckle. Meanwhile, Mr. Fidgety is getting more annoyed by the second.\n\nObviously, conventional buckles will also take time to unfasten, but with practice, you will eventually be able to go faster than with the conventional buckle, since its being small is also a drawback.\n\nThis make comes in two sizes. For adult males over 10 lb., get this larger size, but be sure to tighten it so it's secure. The larger the size, the easier it is to get on. Then, you can tighten it up, once you have kitty in control."

"502456","","","B004BOUFBA","34c2838bbdb711595cc1d36871aac620FRXI","I have used this mask years ago and it was my favorite one.  It stayed on my horse, j could see his eyes through it, so I knew HE could see easily through it as well!  It's softer than the traditional masks and I always get the ones with the ears not to keep the annoying flies out but also to keel ticks out of his ears.  I keel him turned out 24/7 weather permitting and ticks have been spotted around the yard and on a neighboring horse.  This gives me peace of mind that ticks won't be camping out in his ears since it's a hard place to find them in.  I ordered the Warmblood size because, although my guy is a Warmblood (Hanoverian), I forget that he's enormous (18.3hands) and is bigger and has a bigger head than any other horse I know.  His head is probably bigger than most drafts but maybe not as wide...but because most reviews had said that the Warmblood size ran really big, I thought that maybe the draft size would run big too since I was originally going to buy that one.  So I thought, that I could get away with the Warmblood if it ran ""way too big."". Unfortunately, this was so tiny on him that his eyelashes were smoothed against the front of the mesh and he could hardly open his eyes.. so I suppose if you have a normal size Warmblood around the 17 hand range, it would fit nicely.  I would say if your horse is between 16.2-17.2, it would be a good fit depending on the breed though.  My friend has a 16.3 hand TB and his face is much narrower than a warmbloods and is way too big for him.\n\nI reordered the draft size like I shod have done originally lol...should be here tomorrow and then I will write a review on how it holds up with my boy.  Fingers crossed that one fits!!\n\nIf it's the same quality as years before, I'm sure I will love it.  It's perfect for riding...great visibility and softer than the average.  My last horse never rubbed it off either.  I see some reviewers saying it's not as durable...well no, given the design, I would think it would be obvious it won't be as durable as those ugly, stiff mesh masks that hardly feel flexible at all.  I do feel like, as long as you know your horse isn't a fly mask murderer, it will hold up fine.  Just make sure you check the fence for any sharp parts that could potentially rip it.  Otherwise, if your horse is rough on its masks, keep this one to ride with only since it's got much better visibility and is safer.  Use the ugly ones for turn out! I'm expecting the mask to be the same great quality as before.  I'm impressed with all cashel products.  They have never let me down and they don't break the bank!"

If you don't know that it is there (like I didn't) and you dump the bags in your tank, they are extremely difficult to find.  They are difficult to find before you dump the sand in your tank.  And the stuff doesn't work anyway.\n\n2.  I cannot fathom why they instruct you NOT to rinse this sand.  I can only assume that it has something to do with the live bacteria, but frankly I would rather the bacteria die than deal with the nightmare that I dealt with.  This stuff completely covered everything in silt: my tank walls, my overflow, my entire sump and everything in it.  I had to change my filter pads twice in 24 hours and the really fine silt went right through my filter floss and is still sitting all over the place.  Now anytime I stick my hand in there the water clouds right up again.  I ended up having to drain my tank back down and rinse the sand inside my tank.  Don't pay attention to their instructions, RINSE THIS SAND!  Then dose your tank with another live bacteria product, like Seachem Stability."

I have lost count of how many bags we've been through, but it must be around 50-75 by now.  Although these are marked as treats for dogs, there's no reason why they can't be treats for CATS as well!  My Siamese loves these crunchy little cubes.  They break easily if you want to make them a smaller size, but they don't crumble so badly that you end up with a Pablo Escobar mountain of powder.  Freeze dried meat is a much better snack than any kind of meat-flavored cereal product.....which is basically what all mass-market kibble or treats really are.  I'd rather that my animals get an actual meat product.\n\nIf you're sitting there wondering if the price is too high....well, they are not cheap.  But contemplate these 2 things: a) it's a lot cheaper to feed the animal that you chose to guard good quality stuff, than it is to treat feline or canine diabetes in the long run, and b) animals don't get paid for doing their job of being a companion; they don't earn money that they can then use to shop for things they want.  That's means its up to you to do your part to acquire their favorite things.  My cat loves these, as do all the other dogs and cats in our extended family, ad we feel good about giving them a healthy, high quality treat.  We'll continue to buy these forever."

"513989","","","B005R2O27I","1e17465aaab59b5f27a0403615d3461aLM7O","This nano cube is a great option for those who are looking for a small, stylish, all in one aquarium.  When I heard 4 gallons, I expected smaller, but its actually a pretty good size.  Maybe a bit too big for my office desk since my desk is kind of small, but I keep it on top of a bookshelf in my office which it fits perfectly and provides some additional lighting for the room.\n\nThe material seems to be well made and everything worked out of the box.  Plenty of documentation, which I thought was very easy to read and would be great for beginners.  The light is pretty stylish and is quite powerful.  I have my tank pretty heavily planted and everything seems to be thriving with the exception of carpet.  Due to the size, I think the larger plants are robbing the bottom of the tank of light.  But that is okay since there is enough growth to make it look like a jungle.\n\nThere is a glass top that has some little plastic knubs to get have enough room for some ventilation and air flow.  I was able to sneak a heater cord through that opening, but the glass top on that side of the tank is now a bit higher than the rest.  Something I can deal with, but people who are more OCD may have a problem with the lack of space for cords.\n\nThe filter is the same on the 4 gallon as the 6 and 9.  So in theory, when it comes to filtration, the 4 smaller tanks should be theoretically better than the other 2.  But I'm not 100% happy with the filter.  It seems good enough, but I'm not a huge fan of filters that hang inside the aquarium.  I much rather have it hang in the back or have a separate compartment.  With that said, I haven't had any huge issues with the filter.  Current is just right - enough to break the surface of the water, but gentle enough to not cause huge issues for a Betta.\n\nAll in all, its a pretty well built product and I would recommend it, if you think the price is right, or can get a good deal on it.  I'm not sure if its worth that much more than its competitors when it comes to build quality, but it is a good product and quite aesthetic.  All in all, you won't be disappointed."

We've all seen (and used) the giant, hard plastic cones that the vet's office provides afterwards.  They are unwieldy, uncomfortable, and hurt the pet any time they bump into something.  This soft recovery collar improves on all of those issues.  It has weight to it, but no so much that a pet cannot easily lift its head, it is softer and more flexible so as to provide a greater range of movement, and it has some give to it so when a pet bumps into something it won't hurt as much.  This cone, while flexible, will still retain its shape fairly well--my dog was never able to get at her stitches after surgery despite all her maneuvering to do so.  The velcro used to open and close the cone is also a nice feature; easy for a human to open or close, but stays firmly in place when a pet tries.  The velcro also keeps the cone at the size you want, so it won't get tighter or looser on a pet's neck.\n\nThe only slight downside is that this cone gets real dirty, real fast.  A cheap plastic cone can be cleaned much easier and faster.  This cone got every sneeze, drool, food particle, and drip of water on it, and it showed.  You can wipe it reasonably clean by hand, but the stains themselves are likely to remain without more vigorous cleaning.  This wasn't a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.\n\nOverall I was very happy with this cone and after my dog recovered from surgery I saved this cone against future need.  It's a good product to have."

But the collar neck was too loose and the depth was too long. My cat does not enjoy wearing this collar. It upsets him. So I don't use the collar very often.\n\nMy advice -- measure your cat's neck before you buy this. If the correct size is not available, don't get it. Get some other brand of recovery collar. The 4.5 to 7 inch size is probably for a kitten. Most adult cats don't have a neck that small. If the collar is too small, it can hurt your cat or injure them\n\nI adjusted the collars depth by cutting the plastic, but only half of the collar can be cut because the other half has metal snaps in it. If the collars neck is too small, it cannot be adjusted. The collar is not easy to put on and off because the metal snaps are sometimes difficult to unsnap. The collars neck is lined. The plastic is hard, but flexible.\n\nI would not use this as a recovery collar. The metal snaps give the collar extra weight. While wearing this collar, a cat could injure their neck while jumping on and off something. A cat would not be able to eat while wearing this. My cat is an indoor cat only. I would not put this collar on an outdoor cat. An outdoor cat sometimes needs to defend themselves, and they could not do that while wearing this collar. Also, the collar could get stuck on something, such as a tree branch or a fence."

I wanted 100% wool because cotton, acrylic & polyester sweaters simply don't stand up in truly snowy cold. Not only is this 100% wool, it is an adorable print & style that I'd be happy to have in a matching sweater for me (but that might be a bit matchy-matchy eccentric.) The medium fit my 16 pound Maine Coon (yes, a cat) perfectly. Main Coon's are built like little dogs & he wears a dogs harness which is more roomy in the neck & chest than cat harnesses. The cowl neck can be rolled up or down for comfort. I also rolled the back end up a bit just to ensure no accidents while doing his business. The sweater is thus very accommodating. Lots of compliments on the cute-factor of this very practical & beautiful garment. Kitty found it both warm and comfortable. This is not a cheap sweater, but compared to most pet garments it is excellent value for money.

However, the bag it comes with is made of an extremely flimsy nylon that is so thin you can see through it. It also lacks any sort of carrying strap meaning you have to heft this thing around in hand rather than throwing it over your shoulder and having a free hand...something that is crucial if you are traveling with your dog.

My aquarium lighting is not the best, but I do use a Zoo Med Coral Flora Sun Plant Growth Bulb with some effectiveness.\n\nKeep in mind, please, that this plant grows VERY slowly.  That being said, it really seems to thrive under my light conditions.  Below is a photo of the plant today.  It's leaves have spread out a bit.

I have a mutt (border collie dachshund mix) who since she was a pup has suffered from high PH in her urine. We tried a series of things to find the cause, and traced that some of it was caused by the protein levels in her food. Keeping the level lower helped but didn't fix the problem. Some crystals would form when the urine went really high, but it wasn't true crystal problems, no stones, and not even a UTI, though she had some symptoms caused of UTIs because of the high PH (we are talking 9.2 on terrible days!). I started to find supplements to add in the hopes that something would help her problem. I started with only natural pet cranberry urinary formula, and got some results, we got the PH to a steady 8.0 which was still high but better. After that we tried solid gold berry balance which so many reviews said were AMAZING, nope after only a few days we saw the condition get worse and even ended up with a UTI to treat. Back to hunting! At this point we are a year in, different supplements and meds from the vet did nothing, and my hunt was coming up empty. Then one day in my hunt this popped up, what did I have to lose? So I gave it a shot. It was a slow crawl.... took almost 2 full weeks to work, but BOOM we hit 6.8 which is RIGHT where it belongs! First the first time EVER her urine is normal.

I ordered the #8 for my 3 lb 4 oz maltipoo who measures 11 inches around her chest and 7 inches around her neck and is almost 9 inches from neck to tail and it fit perfectly, though not quite to her tail. My only complaint is the hood, it's an odd design, super shallow so not usable as an actual hood at all and it's not integrated into the knit of the body itself like most sweaters but is just sewn on onto the very back of the collar kind of like an afterthought..  But the pom pom on it is cute and I guess as a decorative feature the hood works. I just wish they had shown it in the product pic as I may have passed on the sweater had I known it was so odd."

This is for older small dogs (Havanese), like 6-11, and my dog is 3.5. I used to buy IAMS from my vet for my Golden Retriever. It did not help arthritis and hip problems, or fatty tumors they are prone to. But she was otherwise very healthy and happy and lived until about 12. I have done a lot of research and can't find anything related to China about the ingredients or where it is made and bagged. Everything about China was polluted and growth of food an fish seemed to be dependent on human sewage, air pollution, and heavy metals in the air and soil. We thought the fish were safe until we saw fish floating in the rivers and bed pans being washed out in the rivers. Even toilets went right into the rivers and streams and many fresh water lakes can't be swam in or that/those person/s will die.\nMy dog likes IAMS so I do to, will buy more, and I hope this helps."

My dogs are super smart and I attribute that to Victor. My eldest is healthy and 17. Which one is he? To the person with poo issies...Ive never had a dog with incontinent bowels. You may need to bowel train him. No food after 5 p.m No water after 8. We give 1 cube when we go 2 bed at 10ish. Poor dog and poor you. I will not allow any housekeeper to clean up after my dogs. It seems demeaning. I was a maid myself a long time ago before I married a no good Secret Service agent. I ended up with the dogs. Thankfully so. Also try a limited ingrediant dog food and only dry kibble. If you can buy it at Wal Mart or grocery its not 5 star, 3 if u r lucky! It does not need corn, wheat or soy. Those are fillers and mostly come out the other end, Look 4 a named meat for first ingredient like say just chicken or beef, next another whole meat or meat meal, chicken, beef or fish meal are all good as 2nd ingredients. Stay away from by products...they also just by pass the GI tract. The food can be cheap. I feed Victor for adults and puppies. Red bag. All animal feed stores have small to huge bags, A 40 lb bag is only $31 here. Also CO OPS carry it. Get grain free. I have a healthy 17 year old 6 year old and 6 month old. All can hold it longer than I can...I may have 15 accidents a year...usually when they got in garbage or who knows what. I removed all the carpet. I miss it in my bedroom. Hope those tips help u out. BTW, u can look Victor up on here and its $50 plus just to get an idea. If Im lazy I buy it on here and eat the cost, my little ones take a long time so I store it in its original bag in 2 garbage bags in freezer. I usually keep about 5 lbs in a plastic storage container. All USA animals in the food. Mostly usa fruit and veggies and made in USA. Cheers!!!"

I took my bottle in to the vet and she said, yes all of these ingredients were great BUT: amounts stated aren't quite accurate because it's per OUNCE, and you are giving the dog a TEASPOON, so it's misleading! I have since switched to Dasuquin Advanced.... previously I was using Glycoflex with decent results and while this Liquid Health was great, it sucked to need 16oz a month and then see that the dosing and the stated amounts were not in fact what they are selling you.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nPros:\n- I like the price and amounts of each ingredient. I'm tired of paying 60 bucks for half the quantity of half the ingredients.\n- bottle was easy to open (I have arthritis in my right hand, it's hard for me to grip things).\n- did not smell like garbage, more like bouquet sauce.\n- I could easily stick my syringe down in the bottle and pull up her dose (no problem wasting product except my own stupid hand).\n\nCons:\n- someone stuck label over half the dosing.\n- my dog didn't seem to want any by itself... on a scrambled egg she kind of figured whatever right?\n\nObviously I haven't had time to see about the GI upset. I will update in 3 weeks and say about performance... I have a 3 yo pit bull/Am Staffie who has torn her cruciates... and a 17 year old dog who is just 17!\n\nTASTE: not the best but on food it's ok. Might only do a little on the side of each meal so they can still enjoy meals!\n\nUSE: I use a syringe to measure all of my meds... maybe part of why my dog didn't like the syringe (she's had peroxide forced down before because she ate 3 lbs of rotten meat). I didn't have a problem with packaging other than the label being covered up (and I peeled those off).\n\nCharlotte says she's ok with trying it for about 3 weeks to see if it's any better, worse, or the same as the glycoflex stage 3.\n\n2/18/17 update\nPouring this into a tsp now, works just fine and not losing product to spillage. They don't seem to mind it just drizzled on food, eating well.\n\nMy younger dog is doing really well, not limping nearly as much and we have increased activity!  My older dog isn't doing so well but he is 17 so... day by day with him. It seems to help.\n\nOrdering more! Will be updating again with a vet review."
"538195","","","B00DJRDKF8","a58d2f952d8761a65756e39905030a94US6N","My older dog went blind a few months ago, and the transition has been difficult.  One issue in particular is that he can't see his food, and when he eats, he gets it all over the place.  It isn't his fault, at all, but I knew there had to be a solution to a kitchen floor dirty with pieces of his homemade food everywhere.  I purchased this Wetnoz bowl in large, which has a 5 cup capacity, as well as the medium size, which has a 3 cup capacity.\n\nBoth sizes of the bowls work wonderful for my dog, who is a smaller dog at around 24 pounds.  The bowls are shallow and wide, with the back a bit more raised than the front, so it makes it easy for him to eat his food without straining and without getting it all over the floor.  The bowl has a ""foot"" or stand that is covered in silicone, which makes the bowl stay in place and not move at all.\n\nWhile both sizes of bowls work well for my dog, I prefer the larger size even though my dog isn't a large dog, because I home cook for him, and often chop/puree different ingredients right  before I serve him.  With the size of the large bowl, I can do that directly in the bowl, which saves time and effort in washing an extra bowl.\n\nI am very pleased with Wetnoz scoop dog bowls and highly recommend them to any dog owner."

Better accessibility.\nNow for my complaints... the wood is very slippery so the first times my cats tried to jump on, they sipped off & now, are skeptical to use.(Ill add material)  Also, for the price, I feel there are not NEARLY enough , strategically placed and staggered, steps/surfaces (based on picture I thought it was better than reality) to safety & easily get cats to top.

He would attack Chewie and kick and hug him, then runaway and come back to do it all over again.  Worked perfectly instead of a boring kickaroo.  Our dogs have gotten a hold of him on occasion even though we try to reserve it for our cat still.  He has a small hole in him as one of our dogs chewed through it, but a little mending and he's still kicking around the house.  It's a great toy for both pets, however if you have dogs that are chewers and like to get out stuffing, this one would not be for you because the plushy soft material is no match for them.  But for normal non ""power"" chewing dogs, Chewbacca is a great toy.  Great for a cat kickaroo replacement as well."

The mesh varieties fit perfectly in a size M and they seem to be lasting forever.  I wash them by hand and hang them to dry.  Because they are dark colors, they don't show dirt, so they aren't washed often.  I also purchased a vest type Puppia harness in a size Large due to its running small, and last week was reminded why I only use that one when she is not in a puppy cut because it can slip off her if the two of are walking in different directions.  Fortunately, she returned to me immediately both times, but I did have brief moments of terror as cars drove by us with her off leash.  Wanting to get her something brighter for the summer, I purchased the Watercolor Harness-A in Sky Blue, in a Medium as are her others in this style.  Surprisingly, this cotton harness is a little larger on her, particularly around the neck.  Since the fabric which is about t-shirt weight inside and out and lined with a foam like material doesn't stretch as much as the mesh fabric of the others, it makes sense that it might be a little larger to allow for shrinkage.  At least I'm hoping that's the case.  I will just put it on her now with the chest strap drawn a little tighter.  It is really much prettier in person than in the image which does not fully display the sheen of the fabric.  It is quite attractive on her, I might add."

Very happy it is available on Amazon. Great price for top quality dog food. It has great wholesome ingredients (no by products and no strange fillers). This did not cause allergic reaction (itchy swollen paw pads) to my dog. My dog became allergic or sensitive to other name brand dog foods that I used to feed (Pedigree and Caesars).\nPer the Variety Pet food website it's a complete nutrition that can be used as the primary food for your dog. It is rated by the AAFCO each dog food recipe begins with; Beef, Chicken, Turkey or Lamb, accompanied by garden grown Vegetables. Then other ingredients are added such as Pasta, Potatoes, Barley or Rice. The food is slow cooked in the can for ultimate flavor. No Preservatives or Artificial Flavors of any kind. No wheat, corn or dairy.\nOne thing to note is that this is high fat content so if your dog is more on the sedentary (not so active) side you will have to adjust the servings accordingly to prevent weight gain.  I have a small dog Shih Tzu/Lhasa Apso so I portion out the can over several days feeding. I do this in addition to the dry kibble he eats freely.  I think this would be great for active dogs!\nIt's rated 4 stars by Dog Food Advisor web site."

IT now contains more fish, I Liked it because there was little to no  fish in the original. Why they changed it, I do not know.  OH yes I do.  Cheaper ingredients more profit.  Legumes are not good for my dogs or cats. I will not pay Orijen for them anymore.  Plus my cats will not eat this unless I don't feed them one day and they finally eat some the second day but always leave most of it in the bowl.  Shame on Orijen. This new idea of leaving out the grain but filling with legumes is awful. (peas or pea starch or pea protein) or navy beans , chickpeas, lentils etc.) Pets cannot digest them, and get no nurtitional value from them, they are fillers.  And look at all the labels the industry that feeds cats and dogsthat show they are all using legumes in the food to make it cheaper. (and to make the protein count higher, although the protein in legumes is undigestable to our pets) I see dry food like this costs  about $6-$10 a lb, or more, now to buy this kibble.  I can buy roast beef for 2.39lb.on sale of course  or whole chickens for 99 a lb. Shame on them, the  profit they must be making at the expense of our pets must be astronomical.. . BEWARE I just saw  this  food now offered from 3rd party sellers for  really really 'cheap' , most of it from Korea. Why can they sell so cheap?????? Probably cause korea doen't have the laws the usa and canada have for ingredients in cat food.  it is becoming really scary to try to feed our animals using commercial food.  I am now feeding some raw, but some canned which is healthier for cats than kibble,  (but canned not by much). Cats are desert animals, and need to get their water from the food they eat, not from drinking. It keeps them healthier to eat wet food, rather than dry with lots of water later..  I switched to reconstituted dehydrated raw cat food, but have to  mix it with some  chicken broth and meat but the cats learned to love it now.  I just pressure cook a whole chicken for 2 hours and all of it is like mush, even the bones, the cats LOVE IT mixed with the dehydrated Sojos or Thonest kitchen foods. Any changes are suspect to my cats, (I have 5)  it is amazing how many problems like dry skin, bad hair, bad breath and vomiting fur balls, and just plain vomiting  etc, has gotten better now that kibble is going  off their diets.  May the buyer beware and please read labels carefully."

I don't really care, it was super cheap compared to all the others so I'm not complaining. There is a huge space on both sides where something, cat or puppy, could get out. Still not a problem for us, just letting people know. It has clips on both sides so you can either tether a critter in so they can't jump over either side, or tether two. We did keep a leash on both animals at all times, just in case something failed. My puppy peed in it and it was easy to clean up and take care of. Our cat liked the hood part. When we'd pass a yard with dogs we'd put it up and he'd watch out the bottom mesh until we were pass them and then pop back up to watch. it's a little easy to tip backwards, but as long as you don't lean on it, you'll be fine."

I sprinkle very lightly over the top of the litter and then mix it into the first half inch or so. I do that because, if I can smell this strongly (I only have half or less of my sense of smell), I know my cats could find it unbearable. Their noses have to be right down in it. Using it this way for the first time, my cats did not shy away from using the litter box. I tried it on one box first to see if they would shy away from it and use the untreated one. They used both boxes. Now I use it on both boxes. I clean their litter at least once a day. I figure whatever their paws touch will end up in paw prints, albeit invisible, all around my apartment. I sprinkle this powder every other day or so. I use Dr. Elsie's Ultra Premium clumping cat litter for my two (one large 20lb and one small 3lb) cats. All I ever smell is when they are in the process of doing their business and have not yet covered it. My apartment is a one bedroom, living room/dining room, kitchen layout. The cat boxes are in the bathroom and in a closet near the living room. I ask my neighbors and caregiver how my apartment smells and to describe what they smell. Cat odors are never in the description. I hope this information helps. P. S. Please beware of using baking soda in cat litter. Their urine pH is very sensitive. I suspect it could change using baking soda. I don't know, but why take a chance. It is awful watching a cat die from bladder blockage."

I do not recommend the chicken, as I have mentioned in my other reviews, over the last 8 years, both cats and dogs I have had, did not tolerate the chicken flavor of this brand.

"552566","","","B00JS1JB2A","b6776b44f52af31f8c05e229f49dab088DYL","I recently added a Cairn Terrier puppy to the family to serve as an indoor companion dog since my other dogs are working farm dogs.  I have always ""free fed"" my dogs, figuring that if food is always available they won't feel the need to eat to excess.  However in preparation for bringing the puppy home, I did some research on Cairns and was told that terriers are ""different""; that they are way too food motivated to be free fed as they will eat themselves sick over and over again.\n\nWanting to provide a high quality food for the puppy, I decided to try several varieties of the Natural Balance food for him.  The food is labeled as being suitable for all life stages and I like the idea of not having to worry about buying a puppy formula now and switching to something else later.  I also liked that the list of ingredients included things that I feel okay feeding.  Best of all, from the day the puppy arrived, we have successfully free fed, despite all the admonitions not to even try it.  Because the food is high quality and always available he doesn't feel the need to overeat, but simply goes to his feeder whenever he feels peckish and gets as much as he needs.  His weight is perfect and his energy level is good.  His coat is clean and healthy, his eyes are bright and shiny.  In short, I am very pleased with my results after trying the first flavor.\n\nThe ingredient list is as follows: Sweet Potatoes, Bison, Potato Protein, Pea Protein, Canola Oil (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), Dicalcium Phosphate, Potato Fiber, Natural Flavor, Calcium Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Salmon Oil (a source of DHA), DL-methionine, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Natural Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Iron Proteinate, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Potassium Iodide, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B-1), Manganese Proteinate, Manganous Oxide, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganese Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B-6), Vitamin B-12 Supplement, Riboflavin (Vitamin B-2), Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Folic Acid.\n\nI normally prefer that meat be the first ingredient listed for dogs since they are primarily carnivores.  However I can accept Sweet Potato since it is not corn, which is the ingredient typically used by dog food manufacturers trying to create a budget food.  Bison being the second ingredient is acceptable."

We have four beautiful fur-babies and out of the four we have a barker! She is small but that bark is vicious! We have been to the training groups, nothing seems to keep her from protecting her home. That's her job, she thinks it's in her blood line, protect protect and protect!! Well she has trained our newest addition to protect as well!! Oh my goodness, starting to sound like a barking quartet in my house. So we have been using the #1 Rated Dog Training Collar with Remote Clear L.c.d Display a little over two weeks and we already see a huge change in our Zoe and Nala!! That's right both have been using the collars and training together!! Being able to train them both at the same time is easier for us and easier on them.. One of the great things about this anti bark collar, you can train up to three dogs!! Let' s hope I won't need to do that!! The remote has an easy to read LCD display allows you full control on their training! Another thing that is so great about this collar it has different levels so as to train your dog what to do and not to do. Alos there are 2 different size of receiver probes for intensity of vibration. If your dog doesnt respond to your first command and first stage, you just repeat the command and use the next level. This transmitter has a built in flash light, both collars and remote are water proof. The thing I really like is that the product is humane and does NOT harm you fur-babies!! As far as directions go they have the paper pamphlet is included, which is very easy to follow! It does require 3 AAA batteries for the remote they're included(bonus)! I am loving this, it is working so well, and now we can have company without the dogs barking and acting nuts!! Highly recommend!!

"559303","","","B00MQAQZRE","b6776b44f52af31f8c05e229f49dab088DYL","Though surprised by the size of this bed when it arrived (the dimensions were listed but I'm not good at visualizing sizes based on written dimensions), I could immediately tell that it would be comfortable.  It consists of an outer framework that seems sturdy enough to hold its shape for some time, with a softer interior that molds to the shape of the pet laying on it.  Given its size, the carry handle is almost necessary, but does make it easy to move it around.  The bed itself is lightweight so moving it is not a big deal at all.\n\nI was intrigued by the prospect of the removable cover but while it is true that it unzips, I'm not sure how practical it will be to actually wash it.  The cover is not just the canvas but includes the interior cushioning of the bed and I frankly would be concerned about how it would come out of a spin cycle - just as I would be reluctant to put my pillows in the washer.  What I did instead was to cover the entire pillow with a comforter purchased just for the pets.  It will be easier - for me at least - to remove and wash the comforter than to unzip and remove the canvas cover and interior cushioning, and then get them zipped back into place after washing.  However it is nice to know that in an emergency, taking it off and washing it is an option.\n\nUpon setting up the bed with the comforter over it, I called my dog and invited her to get up on it.  She did so immediately and then seemed reluctant to get off it, looking at me with those eyes that said ""I'll come with you if you really want me to follow you, but I'd really rather stay here"".  For reference purposes, my dog is a 45-lb dog built like a cattle dog and she is able to lay comfortably on this bed.\n\nI am giving this a 4-star rating because, while it is a well-made, durable, comfortable, yet lightweight and easy-to-maneuver pet bed, I feel the price is steep for what you get.  The materials - and my guess on the construction time - do not warrant the price asked for it in my opinion."

I was doing my monthly bird food shopping when I came across this cape and just fell in love with it and had to purchase it.  I have 12 cockatiels, 2 conures and 1 amazon and they are always all over me, on my head and my shoulders.  I have always just used a towel or a blanket to cover my shoulders so that I would not get their business all over me.  But, I figured this would be even better than just a towel.\n\nWhen I received this cape and tried it on, it fit me perfectly.  Covered my shoulders and securely stayed in place.  I am 5 feet tall and for me this works.  I was not sure how it would fit because, of some of the reviews mentioning that it did not cover them but, for a petite person it is not a problem.  Now, I did make my husband put it on, even though he did not want too, and he is a big guy over 6ft tall and this did not cover his shoulders and was tight too.\n\nThe cape has really cute birds on it that are taking a bath or shower, very comical.  It has a treat pocket, that my conures like and toys attached that my cockatiels like. It is made well, because I cannot feel their nails digging into my shoulders like I usually can, even after their nails are trimmed.  The stitching on the cape was done well.  The Velcro works and has not fallen apart so, it all stays on me securely.  I can get a little hot from wearing this but, it is not as bad as a towel.\n\nVery happy that I purchased this cape, really does the job of keeping my birds business off my clothing and prevents their nails from digging into my skin.  Not to mention how adorable it is.  This is an item that I would recommend to my fellow bird owners for sure!"

"567403","","","B00S8I6FY6","afe3d8fabe2cc6ac4db98aa9ed449f672TG2","Antlers are a fantastic thing for anyone who has a mega chewing dog.\n\nThey are all natural, mineral rich, unlikely to splinter or break, and last longer than almost any other chew on the market.  They are also odor less, don't stain fabrics (or dog hair) and don't add calories to your dog's diet.  What more could you ask from any product?\n\nWe used to buy a lot of cow hooves and pigs ears.  Pig ears can pack on weight and last about fifteen minutes, hardly long enough to bother buying.  The hooves are great, but a high percentage smell absolutely horrible, plus they are slimy and disgusting to find in your bed where your dog has been having some personal time gnawing on it there.  Then there are bully sticks, but do you know what they really are?  They also don't smell very pleasant after a chewing session.\n\nAntlers are wonderful.  Seriously wonderful.  Wolves have been chewing on them for thousands of years.  How much more natural can you get?  Even better, antlers are a naturally renewable resource, since they are shed each year without killing the animal, unlike hooves, ears, or bones.\n\nThis is a great antler.  Huge.  Ours was given to a 15 lb. mega chewing doxie mix.  It looks somewhat ridiculous, but she loves it and it will last for ages with her.  The only ""negative"" about antlers is the colorful language they inspire when your dog leaves it laying on the floor between you and the bathroom for you to step on at 3 a.m. when you are only half awake or you roll over on it after the dog sneaks it into the bed after you doze off.  We try to minimize this type of experience by putting it into her bed whenever she drags it out somewhere inappropriate.  So far,it seems to be working, as we've not had one of those experiences in a month or more.  (We keep her stocked up with antlers to ensure she chews them instead of our bedding, as she chews whenever she is stressed out by being home alone, a storm, etc.  They have saved our bedding after discovering the antlers were highly desirable chews!)\n\nWe have three dogs.  Out of the three, only our devout chewer chews these antlers.  The other two aren't interested, but they are not devoted chewers.  They don't gnaw on anything inedible.  So, if your dog chews on stuff, be it their toys, your shoes, your furniture, or whatever...antlers may be your best friend.  However, if your dog isn't a dog that loves to gnaw, this isn't going to inspire gnawing either.  I hope that it helps!"

It is very easy to install, there are no straps that are meant to go UNDER the seats (which isn't possible on many cars). Do far it has stayed in place.\n\nPROS\nThe fabric seems durable enough, the straps are NOT elastic which is good as those always stretch out of shape. The fabric is soft not an unpleasant scratchy material.\n\nYou can put it on/off in two minutes. I've seen some that are complicated enough that once they are on, you don't want to be bothered taking them off.\n\nThe bottom have has ""fitted"" edges which protects the sides of the seats well. There is a ""handle"" which fits in-between the bottom and top parts of the seats to help it stay in place.\n\nCONS\nThe upper portion could be wider, it does not completely cover the edges of the back part of the seat. I can live with this as the dogs don't often get THAT dirty where it will be an issue.\n\nThe addition if a second strap further up on the back portion would help alleviate that and insure it covers more of that portion of the seat.\n\nFor the price I am happy. I can't see spending an excess amount on actual fitted covers as they will likely need replacing every few years."

I used this for fry as well as to isolate a fish that was recovering from an aggressive fish attack while it healed.  This worked for all my purposes and came as expected for a great price.  I can see where it would be easy to break if you don't have the corners lined up when they are being pressed together, but even with my giant hands I managed to make it happen.  BTW, there weren't any English directions in the package, but it wasn't too tough to figure out where the round pegs went.\n\n***UPDATE***  1-3-18  I have been using this for over a year now and I just got two more, as well as two of the larger size available from other sellers.  The suction cups worked for me for about 5 months on the smaller net, maybe it was because the glass was especially clean, but then they were unreliable, the larger net I got never worked with the suction cups.  Having said that, I DIDN'T LIKE THE SUCTION CUPS ANYWAY.  The suction cups seemed like a good idea, until I did the first water change and I had to continually lower the basket on the way down and then slowly raise it back up as I refilled the tank.  When doing a water change, this basket will still be at the top of the tank and the fish that are in it then out of the water and can't breathe. I also got sidetracked briefly when refilling once and let the water get above the net, which immediately let the fish out.  Great, I didn't need something else to mess with when I'm doing water changes and already fighting the constant battle to keep from making a mess!  So, I took off the suction cups and added foam to make the basket float.  It is now always at the right level, no matter what else is going on in my tank now and it's one less thing for me to fiddle with when doing water changes.  Right now, I have 6 total floating in my 75 gal tank and they are all full of guppy fry.  I have not used the Lee brand nets of similar construction but those do have a metal clip made to hook over the side of your tank, so that would hold better than the suction cups, but it would still be a pain for water changes.  I have also seen complaints posted about the metal clip falling off.\n\nIn response to the negative reviews:  I have not torn any of my nets except for where the suction cups mount and I fixed those easily.  The suction cups don't hold very well, but I can say that about all the suction cups I have tried on air lines and heaters also.  My guppy fry have only gotten out when there was a small hole I didn't see or when the box got knocked below the water line.  I have looked at several similar products on Amazon with 4+ stars, all more expensive for a box with identical construction.  It is my opinion that you can pay more, but you cant get any better product than this, so why are there so many reviews for this one that are negative?  The shipping is painfully slow by Amazon standards, but these all arrived by the date advertised, so there is nothing legitimate for me to complain about in that department.  If you have to have it right now, I recommend driving to your local fish store and pay $9 to get the same thing with the Lee brand name.\n\nTIP:  When I got the new ones, the first think I did was use a razor blade to cut off the small pegs that the suction cups are supposed to slide onto.  If you are not using the suction cups, these pegs are only good for making holes in the net.  Then I wrapped foam pipe insulation around two of the rails on top of the basket to make it float.  I used insulation made for 1/2 inch pipe, smaller would be better just don't use the ones that have adhesive tape in to the seam.  Lots of things can be used to make this float, it doesn't weigh much at all, use your imagination.\n\nTIP 2:  To patch small holes made from the suction cup pegs or snags:  I dried the net, then held it flat on top of a metal lid, placed a drop of hot glue on the hole and rolled it flat with a small scrap of PVC, then carefully peeled the net off of the metal.  These glue patches are flat and nearly invisible, I really only see them in the tank because I know where to look."

Even though he has gotten better (he won't mark his own food/bed and such anymore), he still us not trustworthy around my white furniture, so even though he goes potty outside on command, he needs belly bands or as I prefer boy dog diapers (As most belly bands are flat, tight and restricting and I won't use them). I used to buy him custom boy dog diapers that were washable but pricey (etsy) but since these looked so fun, I gave them a try and was positively surprised on the design, they are kinda made out of tee shirt like material, so they are light and breathable, they have also a sewn on edge that eventhough it's no waist band has some roominess to it. I think these are a good solution for incontinent dogs, puppies in training or chronic markers. The xxs size fit my 3lb (12""measurement) Pom on middle setting, but again I like to keep them a bit loose. I would suggest to always get vet or trainer advise on how to use any sort of belly band or diaper prior to getting them, depending on the situation though.\n\nPROS\n+great value\n+well made\n+very cute design\n+material is comfy and breathable and not too tight, allowing space for breathability\n\nCONS\n-I do prefer the belly ands that have a stretchy waistband/pouch design better for comfort\n\nALLTOGETHER\nGreat set to get if you are on a budged and/can't get customized bands.

"581195","","","B014BXNJWC","27e80d71f9c2c0960d5661e3ad51ef5e8MTI","Our fiesty feline has a biting problem. He was not properly socialized as a kitten and when we brought him home at 8 weeks, he discovered that he hated seeing the sight of our hands and to retaliate from his fear, latched on to our legs, arms, and sometimes face by biting and scratching. Although we tried kitty nail covers, Comfort Zone plug-in diffuser, taking him to numerous vet visits for recommendations, eventually he was diagnosed by a feline behaviorist with ""play-induced aggression."" She gave us a ton of tips for a kitty with his behaviors I will share here:\n1) Pheromone collars work A LOT better than plug-in diffusers because the smell is continuous! With our kitty, we tried many varieties of calming collars including more expensive ones like Nuturecalm and Thunderease; however, those brands are much more expensive and don't work as well. The Sentry Collar is the best because the smell is the most potent. We learned over time that our kitty required a new collar every 3 weeks for his behavior management, not 30 days like the package recommended. Also, the package instructions recommends shaking the excess powder off before putting it on the kitty. Wrong!!! If you do that, you will render it essentially ineffective. It always took two of us to put it on our kitty and leave at least two finger widths underneath the collar and between your kitty's skin.\n2) Comfort Zone Plug-in Diffuser: We used in every room. Our kitty would go up to it and smell them daily. However, we are not sure it really did anything looking back, but he enjoyed a good whiff of it. Our vet said that the American Association of Feline Friendly Hospitals states that every vet office should have a plug-in diffuser now in every room to calm kitties when they go the the vet's office.\n3) Spray bottles filled with water in every room to deter negative behavior: The kitty psychologist suggested that cats hate water and spray bottles can stop negative behaviors before they start. It helped if the spray bottle was around and in hand before an attack was going to occur; however, there were times in which our kitty got us in an area of the room where the spray bottle was not located. Easy solution- add more spray bottles everywhere!\n4) Toys, Toys, and More Toys: Our kitty was the type to want to play all day, every day, which was good for him, but we also couldn't indulge him in that because it would essentially create more fiestiness. We were told to limit his play time to 15 minutes per day and give him only toys where our hands were not associated with them, including wand toys, round circular toys, kitty kicking sticks, and robotic toys. We were told to only give him catnip one time per week because anything more than that and kitties become tolerant and it is not as effective for them. During our non-play times, due to the pheromone collar in large part, our kitty became a snuggler to our surprise!!!! We were so pleased to have him come and knead and purr on our laps and seek our attention when we never thought that was possible before!!!\n5) Scratching Posts: Our kitty psychologist suggested that our kitty needed an outlet for all of his energy and she suggested placing multiple types of scratching posts all over the house. We got him fancy, expensive ones including SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post and PetFusion 3-Sided Vertical Scratching Post, but he preferred the cheapest kind: Fat Cat Big Mama's Scratch 'n Play Ramp. We LOVED that one the most and they were so cheap to be able to place in multiple rooms, plus the corrugated cardboard insert can be flipped over to elongate its use!\n6) Cat Condo and a room with a view: Our kitty psychologist suggested that our kitty needed entertainment throughout the day and constant stimulation. She suggested we purchase a cat condo and it was a great decision. We originally purchased Armarkat Cat's Beige Tree Model and it was super sturdy and well constructed. We moved and had to get a different one and the replacement was cheaply constructed and broke immediately: Cat Tree Scratcher Play House Condo Furniture Bed Post Pet House. I would not recommend that purchase. However, we also purchased Nature's Hangout Window Bird Feeder with Removable Tray- possibly the best idea we've ever had. Since then all sorts of birdies would come to the window and chirp and my kitty even learned how to chirp back! We got him this toy during the winter months when the birdies fly south for winter and he misses his friends. The bird toy has the most excellent rendition of a real bird chirp that we have ever heard! It is a loud chirp that may be heard a couple of rooms away, but it always brings a smile to my face because I know my face is enjoying snuggling up to his bird toy and dreaming of the day when his birdie friends will come back for a visit! This entertained our kitty for hours on end and the scratching and biting decreased tremendously while the snuggling and purring increased!!\n7) Time: Time, patience, persistence, and A LOT OF CONSTANT LOVE and REASSURANCE helps calm behavioral issues with a fiesty feline. We are super proud of our kitty that his behaviors improved tremendously over time. They never resolved immediately, but we knew to avoid triggering the behaviors: avoid placing your hands in front of his face, if ears are bent backwards- watch out, don't pick up because that is overstimulating, let the kitty come to you, give kisses using your face to his forehead and don't have your hands anywhere in sight, avoid loud noises or startling movements to cause fear in him, use Cool Kitty Cat Calming Pheromone Spray liberally and often in addition to everything else (esp. at night before bed to avoid nips to the face or head while sleeping), and ensure that the kitty has a full belly. If the kitty is hungry, the kitty is more likely to attack.\nIt can be done. Do not give up. It is well worth the struggle. It will get better. We can truly appreciate our kitty and understand him better and his needs because of the struggle we have had to endure due to the lack of socialization he was given as a kitten."

Was pretty pleased on how the original box was in perfect shape.\nEverything inside the box looks in order, item as described. Will be testing a run soon after the weekend.\n\nUpdate: Accurately precise when well calibrated, stumbled over one video from Utube by FishOfHex. He probably has the better video instructions on setting up this unit, very easy to understand with his step by step walk through in  calibration and time/schedule and final setup.\nDo take note that in calibrating your unit, you should use airline tubing cut-to-fit the units final placement. If you do calibrate the unit with a different length of airline tube compared to the final length of airline tube you will be using for the units final placement, then there will be a slight if not a huge difference (depending on how long or short the airline tube will be used) in the amount of dose the unit will pump in. So, the longer tube youll be using for placement compared to the original length you used for calibrating will therefore result to an under dose and an overdose if the airline tube is shorter than the ones used for calibrating it."

The rest is extremely small pieces/chicken dust and can't be fed to them as I normally hand them treats, I have to put it on a plate and when they try to suck up the dust it winds up going everywhere just from them breathing on it.

I'm a light sleeper with a hamster in the room, so he usually woke me up several times a night with his old wheel from PetsMart. I gave him this one last night, and all I could hear was the faint pitter patter of his feet on the plastic, like a soft rain on the window. It doesn't bang around in the glass tank like the old one because it's heavy enough to stay put regardless of the hamster's speed. It's also big enough for my Syrian to fit comfortably so he's not arching his back to fit inside. He loves it, I love it, and I just wish I'd found this years ago for my last one."

If you need a serious diaper, Im not as confident about recommending this. It falls off the shoulder a bit on my girl, and the bottom doesnt stay securely fitted to her bottom. That could be because she has no tail to help hold it on (Tails rock, don't dock!), or maybe its because shes overweight, so clothes don't always fit her as intended. I think this is just one of those items youll have to try out on your own furbaby to see if it works for you. If nothing else, you're getting a unique and really adorable outfit. Great for a photo session. See my attached pics for some real cuteness."

It doesn't leak because of a gasket where the ball bearing sits, but if she doesn't drink from it right away, the ball will get stuck to the rubber and her tongue isn't able to make it release the water. Kind of strange, maybe my cat needs to work on her tongue muscles. It's pretty good! I just with the bottle was slightly larger and had a little floaty indicator.

The larger size is made of two gel panels that are encased in one plastic mat. Theres a bit of an indent in the middle, in the gap between the two gel pads, which makes the mat easy to fold in half for storage.\n\nIts easy to tell if the mats working; just press your hand down onto the material, and you can feel the cooling effect in seconds. It works for up to three hours at a time, after which it requires a short break to cool down and recharge, so to speak. To speed things up, you can pop the mat in the fridge, but refrigeration is not required. Nor are batteries or water.\n\n(I also own Lotfancys cooling vest, which you have to wet before use; the item has to stay damp at all times. The mat is a huge improvement, imho, probably thanks to the plastic casing which I assume traps the moisture.)\n\nI had trouble getting my dogs to stay on the mat, on account of they prefer soft cushy blankets. But this would be great for lining a kennel or dog bed, especially on warm days or summer car rides to the beach. It wipes clean easily with a damp cloth, so don't worry about a little sand or mud!\n\nThe stitching on the pad looks pretty solid, and the material seems like it should hold up well under thick dog nails. However, even the larger size is only big enough for small- to medium-sized dogs. I guess you could use it to cool a Rottweilers belly, though!\n\nThe instructions warn against placing the mat in direct sunlight. When not in use, be sure to store the mat in a plastic bag so that the gel doesnt evaporate.\n\n** Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review. **"
