While she has been very close a few times with her music, not anything definitive. Also with the recent heartbreak she has undergone from her suicide attempt, many people have wondered if she has been able to re-deliver. Her latest single, Bittersweet from her album Back To Me isn't really all of that. While the song isn't bad, and so far is one her better songs, it just hasn't been definitive to what Fantasia has really to blossom to. I do hope that Fantasia can really wow everyone for her next single, but from what I've heard from Back To Me I really cannot say.\n\nSong: C+"

I have always been a fan of Chrissie's, from the very beginning of the Pretenders first release back around 1979. I have every CD, Concert DVD, Video DVD, & Box Set released by all the various versions of the Pretenders. I even have a DVD of Chrissie & the Pretenders being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, near Chrissie's hometown of Akron, Ohio.\n\nI'm happy for Chrissie, that she has finally found her perfect lover, ""LUCKY JP"". I love Chrissie, but I'm a little jealous of that JP guy. Just like some of the other reviewers, I've always had a crush on Chrissie, but I also love her music and videos. This Deluxe Edition is one great package for a Chrissie Lover. The songs tell a tale about the love story between her and JP, and the struggles they had to overcome. It's a beautiful, real life issue, love story that ends with commitment & fidelity. The Deluxe Edition contains 2 bonus songs: ""Christmas Soon"" and ""Skinny Love"". The Bonus DVD contains videos for ""If You Let Me"", and ""The making of If You Let Me"".\n\nThis is a real treat, for any Pretenders &/or Chrissie Hynde fan. Thanks!!!!!"

Young ""Stevie"" Winwood as he was known back then was just 18 years old when the Spencer Davis Group burst onto the scene in early 1967. Within just a few months the group boasted a pair of Top Ten singles. Yes, the future appeared extremely bright for this four man band from Birmingham, England. But Stevie Winwood had other ideas. Before the end of the year he would leave the Spencer Davis Group to form his own band that he dubbed Traffic. Winwood's timing was impeccable because Top 40 radio was just beginning to wane and within just a few years album-oriented rock stations would come to dominate the FM band. Over the next decade Traffic would become a staple of these AOR radio stations. In 1969 Winwood also became a part of rock's very first supergroup Blind Faith. Then in 1980 Steve Winwood would embark on a highly successful solo career.\n\nDuring the decade of the 1980's Steve Winwood would amass more than a dozen charted singles including 6 Top Ten hits.  Of these the most  acclaimed was hit 1986 # 1 hit ""Higher Love"".  With background vocals from Chaka Kahn ""Higher Love"" would spend a total of 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  The song would snag a couple of Grammys including ""Record of the Year"" and ""Pop Male Vocal"" of the year.  One of the best singles of the 1980's."

That record went absolutely nowhere in the U.S. and the tune had been largely forgotten until early 1968 when People decided to record a cover version. ""I Love You"" did quite well in the USA peaking at #14 and selling more than a million copies worldwide. It was also a hit in Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada.

This I can believe since at the end of the day, Shambhu and his insightful selection of collaborating musicians has paid off rather handsomely, and by their collective time spent together, have helped convert this debut release into a commodity of premium value.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey is New Age Fusion, Contemporary Instrumental, and Jazz, having East, West, and World elements which help facilitate the conversion of artful melodies into solid gold entertainment that requires only simple involvement for the rest of us to acquire the appreciable benefits of this grand endeavor.  Sacred Love has already achieved a quantifiable amount of success, where at present Sacred Love - Feel The Journey is # 1 for the month of October 2010 in ZMR's Top 100 Chart, but I also have a feeling this album will appreciate in value even more over time.\n\nShambhu is an esteemed musician in his own right performing concerts or on albums with top music entertainers like Bob Hope, Carlos Santana, Jon Anderson and on Whitney Houston's multi-platinum album titled simply Whitney.  The list goes on since Shambhu has also been involved in projects with many of the respected musicians I continually write about like Will Ackerman, Jeff Oster, Eugene Friesen, Ann Licater plus many more.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey on the Acoustic Shine label has an impressive cast and crew since many have toured or recorded with top musical groups themselves.  Some of these artists on Shambhu's album include Tony Levin of Peter Gabriel on bass, Jeff Haynes of Pat Metheny on percussion, George Brooks of John McLaughlin on saxophone, Celso Alberti of Steve Winwood on drums, and then Premik Tubbs of Santana and John McLaughlin on flute.\n\nTogether is the first of 12 songs total and what a memorable impression it creates.  The center stage guitar and violin pairing established securely alongside flute and reflective instrumentation is magnificent, plus it is easy to visualize this song and others in a Cinematic role since the warm, sincere, and dynamic atmosphere echo the characteristic essentials for a multitude of made for the big screen movie settings.\n\nNatural Moment is a warm and casual song that positively takes off and ascends to new heights.  First expressed during the initial sequences, xylophone and numerous percussion enhancements become the lively components that merge into a free spirited narrative complete with smooth and graceful electric guitar rhythms which intensify and progress neatly into a picturesque arrangement.\n\nMaiu Breeze is refreshing by exhibiting a jazzy tropical presence.  First conveyed by acoustic guitar highlights, the integral xylophone rhythms and harmonious vocals filled with energy and vitality are a natural accompaniment to the guitar arrangement.  Together they merge perfectly to bring out the compositional fascination of this album and its entirety, creating a dynamic atmosphere that leaves one with an impression of total harmonic refinement.\n\nThis first release by Shambhu will always be termed a debut as one might expect, but when you consider his proficiency as a guitarist, the impressive number of outstanding talents on this extraordinary album, and their combined lifework totaling a significant number of decades as esteemed music professionals, then this masterful first album by Shambhu truly does amount to a rewarding and appreciable "" labor of love.

"1140","4","","B00471GFJ8","a00b601c7f9f39324a590355b64eaec8B38X","I was sent a copy of Abica's third album, Numb, without ever having heard this band's music before.  It took a few listens for me to truly grasp this band, but in the end I found Numb to be a very competent effort from a band that quite plainly has a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThe music teeters between full-on hip-hop/rap to alternative rap/rock reminiscent of Limp Bizkit and old Linkin Park.  Layers of synths swirl alongside heavy guitars and drums to create an energetic soundscape that completely carries this album.  The production on the record is top-notch, and some of the best instrumentation I've heard in this genre.  Furthermore, the album has just the right amount of variety to keep it interesting.  At sixteen tracks, you may think it'll be a bit on the long side, but the songs sound different enough that you will never feel the length.  Standout tracks include ""Tell Us Why"", ""The Things You Think I Say"", ""Take This Away"", ""Gave Em A Reason"", ""Never That Far Away"" and ""What You See"".  I must especially single out ""Gave Em A Reason"" as probably the best track on this album.  It's a high-energy thrasher that keeps going till the very end.  On a side-note, from hearing the record I would imagine Abica's live shows to be some of the most energetic and intense around!\n\nUnfortunately, the album does stumble in a few places.  Lyrically, it's hit or miss.  Not that the lyrics are bad, far from it, but they sometimes feel a bit overly simplistic.  It's striking since it's such a stark contrast from the meticulously-crafted music behind them.  A prime example of this is ""Beautiful"", which despite the brilliant backdrop ends up being a rather generic hook-up song.  Another head-scratcher is ""Blurry"", which is an awkward reconstruction of the song ""24"" by Jem (with no mention of original songwriters Jem Griffiths and Justin Griffiths in the linear notes).  It's not a remake, the music, beat and chorus share the same melody with ""24"" but the lyrics are original.  I personally felt the song lacks the punch of Jem's version and ends up the weakest point on the record.  Also, and this isn't really criticism, around two times on the album there is some very melodic singing during the song's bridge.  I would really like to hear more of that!  Not that the rapping and raspy vocals are bad, but the singing just added a little uplift that gave those songs a little more depth.\n\nBut ultimately, Numb's numerous strengths far outweigh its few drawbacks.  Abica has created a strong and robust album that's sure to please fans and invite new ones.  I really enjoy this album, and I definitely look forward to future releases.  I'm anxious to see how this band grows and evolves in the years to come."
"1142","4","","B00471GFJ8","8ca0d2f66ed031c1b747c382a912b349SE1U","Numb by Abica was a hard album for me to review. The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.\n\nIf forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.\n\nMusically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less ""processed"" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing. It has grown on me and I am willing to bet that album #2 takes things to the next level.\n\nStandouts for me:\n\nWhat You See\nNumb\nMy Song\nBlurry\nThe Things You Think I Say\nTake This Away\nNever That Far Away\nNothing Here\nBeautiful\nGave Em A Reason"

In fact, between 1974 and 1986 Don would amass an impressive total of 17 #1 hits on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart.  Despite all of his success as a country artist Don Williams could never seem to come up with the crossover hit that most country artists were always looking for.  Then in 1980 he recorded a ballad written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin.  Don finally had his crossover hit.  ""I Believe In You"" spent an impressive 20 weeks on Billboard's Hit 100 pop charts peaking at #24 in November of that year.  Meanwhile, ""I Believe In You"" would also become Don's eleventh #1 country hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.  Good stuff!"

Not only because they are true blue-eyed soul, but they still are better than what is on radio today. His songs have still the impact today, as they did back in the 80's and 90's. But the one that started the ball rolling for George on his own, I Want Your Sex, the lead single from his breakthrough solo record Faith doesn't feel as controversial as people made it back in the 80's. I liked how George was able to prove himself, away from his Wham image, and it still captures a rawness that still is vibrant as today as was the case back in the 80's. If you have never heard a George Michael song, this is one of the first I recommend.\n\nSong: B 1/2+"

Both the fan base and Damon Albarn would agree that this is the groups weakest album musically. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that this is Gorillaz most ambitious album to date, just for the simple fact that the album's creation was limited at the time of its release. This album was completely composed by Apple iPad music apps. The amount of depth and creativity Damon was able to produce and record off of a simple iPad is truly astounding to me, because despite the album not breaking any new ground sonically, the music on this project is still of high quality. I personally can enjoy this album on its own merit. But when compared to the previous 3 Gorillaz project, it falls short. Because of Damon's choice of using only music apps, the albums sound is not as rich or organic as past albums are. This album has a much more electronic feel than the previous 3 albums and it does suffer for it. The song-writing does not grab your attention as much and the songs aren't nearly as catchy. Its an average project for Gorillaz, but far more creative than most artists can drum up.\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Hillybilly Man\n2) Amarillo\n3) Revolving Doors\n4) Detroit\n5) The Snake in Dallas"

Shonen Knife has covered it faithfully here, but not brought anything new to it.  Except for the female voices, there is very little difference between this cover and the original.  Shonen Knife presents the lyrics with a straightforward delivery that doesn't suit the song's fun-loving vibe; I get the feeling they were spitting the words out more than trying to capture their feel.  It's not bad, but there's absolutely nothing special here."

It's fun, but it grows weary before too long, a little frenzied in a controlled kind of way, just not controlled enough.  There are some interesting sounds and musical enhancements that add a layer of intrigue to the track, but they are compiled atop a rudimentary musical arrangement that gives Friedberger an almost dated feeling.  The horns at the end of the track are a nice touch, but they too don't really feel new or inspired.  They just serve to throw yet another trick in the bag.  It's decent and certainly has its moment, but overall this isn't as inspired as it is obviously trying to be.\n\nI can't say for certain that Eleanor wouldn't grow annoying after four or five tracks, but I'd be willing to give her a try."

Or like some sort of vortex, or the Twilight Zone. If you were going to be stuck anywhere in northern California, it is most likely going to be Lodi. The narrator ends up there after riding in on a greyhound to do a gig, then his friends go missing, his promise of fame vanishes, and he ends up singing the same songs over and over, trying to save up enough money to buy a train ticket out of there. I have never been to Lodi, but it is apparently the ''Zinfandel Capital of the World."" You end up sipping some wine and before you know it you are a resident. I don't think the narrator thinks it's such a bad place, but it must be frustrating since he has been stuck there before. Like you are in a dream and you can't figure out how to wake up."

In a long and successful career he has had a ton of hits that stand out among some of the greatest hits in rock music. The best of his best to me has to be ""Born To Run"". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the ""Boss"" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song. That to me is what makes this song so good. If there is only one Bruce Springsteen song you could download on to your MP3 player this would be that song."

Some of Leona's songs work (Bleeding Love, Better In Time, Brave, I Will Be, her cover of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face) and some of them don't. This one does. It feels like you are at a party when listening to this track. I heard it before when listening to her tracks for her second album on Youtube a few years back but then I recently heard this song again on Last.fm radio and was really, really hooked. I like fell in love with her all over again.\n\nLeona kind of frustrates me sometimes though. She's got the beauty, the talent and the vocal chops but some of her material is boring. I think she could be really, really big if she brought most of her material home on a really, really good album. I heard most of her first album and her whole second album and liked songs on both, but wasn't sold as a whole on either. But I believe in her potential. She's just gotta dig a bit deeper.\n\n4 stars."

They have a hard-rocking, enthusiastic sound that's hard to compete with, and their songs are always catchy and fantastically composed.  And while I have yet to watch ""Highlander"" (I know, I'm a bad nerd...), I heard snippets of the song made famous by it, and decided it was worth a download.\n\nWhile not Queen's most famous song, ""Princes of the Universe"" is a fantastic song by the band, and deserves to be more well-known.  It has the signature Queen sound, part rock and part metal, and all energetic and blood-pumping.  The lyrics get a little lost in the instrumentation from time to time, but if you listen carefully the song is sung from the point of view of one of the film's immortal warriors.  And thankfully, one doesn't have to be familiar with the movie to enjoy said lyrics.\n\nA must-have track if you're a Queen fan, but also worth a listen if you're only casually familiar with them.  And it sure makes me want to give ""Highlander"" a shot now..."

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

You are not able to go away without continuing to hear this incredible music. Heidi Breyer returns with a new unbelievably wonderful 3rd project ""Beyond the Turning"".\n\nIt reminds us that life is a long road and invites us to move along on this exciting journey.\n\nWhat is the first impression of the new album of Heidi Breyer? Her piano music is filled with warmth and sincerity. These melodies are born from the bottom of the artist's heart. Their cordiality and easiness thrill the listener's heart.\n\nBut the emotional impact is not the only memorable feature of ""Beyond the Turning"".

Her summer hit ""Call Me Maybe"" is what first brought my attention to her but then her song ""This Kiss"" sealed the deal. With ""Tonight I'm Getting Over You"" I find that I am liking the range of music that she is getting into. Granted, its Pop music but it has a different sound. She gives her music a certain type of character that you just don't find with Katy Perry or Kelly Clarkson. Here's hoping her career has longevity."

To me, this song is a distant cousin of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" in that it evokes a memory from childhood of discovering something both magical and profoundly emotional. They symphony playing along with John sounds way more soulful than anything ELO ever managed. ""#9 Dream"" is one of those moments where John's artsy side yields something absolutely lovely, as opposed to, say, his artsy side yielding something like ""Two Virgins"". Maybe ""ama bakawa pussy pussy"" was John having a prophetic vision of Pussy Riot and cheering them on?"

The melodies and chord progressions are graceful and tasteful, brought to vivid life by Cranes masterful piano technique, as well as his synthesized orchestration and some accompaniment by Rick Henley on acoustic guitar. At times, both Cranes compositions and performances remind me a little bit of Bruce Hornsby.\n\nThis is a fine CD that is a delight to listen to from beginning to end."
"7845","5","2","B00AFXD08Q","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Pianoforte"" is Timothy Crane's third release, following ""Dragonfly"" (2010) and ""The Other Life I Dream"" (2004). A lifelong musician who started out in a rock band, Crane calls his music ""instrumental pop"" and enjoys including an assortment of musical styles in each collection. This group of twelve original pieces features the piano front and center and includes acoustic guitar by Rick Henley and orchestration created by Crane and Jason Rowsell. Like his previous albums, ""Pianoforte"" was produced on a shoestring budget by independent musicians ""who simply want to create and play music - even if it means recording on the weekends in a basement."" Thanks to technology and Crane's experience, this does NOT sound like music recorded in a basement or garage. Styles range from quiet and reflective to more upbeat and energetic, making this a really good album for driving, working, or just kicking back and getting lost in.\n\n""Pianoforte"" begins with ""What Will I Be?,"" a piece that begins quietly with oboe and piano, suggesting a daydream - perhaps a young child staring out a window, lost in thought. As it evolves, the piece becomes fuller and more orchestrated, sounding more like a film soundtrack. ""Awaken the Dawn"" is quite different with an effervescent piano flourish for starters and a big, powerful orchestra keeping the piece dancing and spinning throughout. ""Clear Creek"" goes in yet another direction with piano and acoustic guitar (with background orchestration) painting a scene of peaceful respite and reflection. ""Untouched"" reminds me of the wonder of discovering places that have been ""untouched"" by civilization - wilderness areas, mountain vistas, remote beaches, etc. Piano, oboe, and orchestra give this piece a range from playful to awe-inspiring.  ""Disappearing Moon"" includes a bold piano part, mandolin (I think!), and full orchestra. The strummed instrument gives the piece a mysterious touch that I really like. ""Red Line"" is a piece Crane often plays in concert but that had not yet been recorded. One of the faster and bigger pieces, I would imagine that this is a real crowd pleaser live! ""Soli Dio Gloria"" is by far the longest track at just over five minutes, and feels emotional and personal, like telling about very moving chapter from ones life or giving heartfelt advice to someone close who is hurting - my favorite on this album. ""Archetype"" is very cinematic and visual with a big sweep and an infectious energy. I really like this one, too! ""Stratford Road"" brings the album to a peaceful and dreamy close with a piece that evokes nostalgia and longing - also a beauty!\n\nEven though this CD is relatively short at 33 minutes, these pieces are all full and complete. Anything more could spoil the mood. Recommended!"

Strong versions of Looks Like Rain, Deal, Mexicali Blues, and Tennessee Jed follow. The Race Is On has always been one of my favorite Bobby covers and this version is well done. China Cat->Rider is it's usual 1973 self which is fantastic. the set is rounded out with Big River, Brown-Eyed Women and Around And Around. The second set starts off with cool versions of Row Jimmy, Jack Straw and Ramble On Rose. The linchpin of this show is one of only three versions of Playing In The Band->Uncle John's Band->Morning Dew->Uncle John's Band->Playing In The Band which is played to the hilt. Stella Blue is pretty and El Paso was always better in the 1970s. Eyes Of The World->Sugar Magnolia brings the show to a close in fine fashion as does the encore of Casey Jones."

However, God of Drum by Kari Hohne, who records under the name of Get Tribal, is certainly one of the most unique. She describes the album as a collection of percussion-based tribal music inspired by the thunder deities of world mythology. According to Kari: Each track was composed based on an archetype and shamanic drumming pattern from different parts of the world.  These reflect Native American, Celtic, Chinese, Norse, African, Mayan, and more. As can be expected, there is a broad spectrum of ethnic instruments, while her parallel interest in electronic music brings in synthesizers, samplers, and other contemporary sounds. Although meditation music is generally soft and soothing, Kari purposely sought to unlock energy.\n\nWhile there is a lot of metaphysics behind the music, and it can be helpful or interesting to know, ultimately its also fine to just press play and go with the flow. The album is a spirited multi-cultural musical experience that anyone can enjoy and groove to. But at its heart, God of Drum by Get Tribal is a powerful musical tool for unlocking energy to create harmony and balance. Her extensive research into archetypes, mythology, and shamanic studies is particularly evident in the music heard on the album. The emphasis on earthy rhythms and world music influences make this one of the most notable offerings in this particular genre. A lot of vision and creativity went into sonically designing each track, and it shows. For me, this album was a pleasant surprise, and one Id recommend in a heartbeat."

I recall how it instantly dominated radio and record sales for weeks on end.\nIts true legacy is its clear ownership of launching the rhythm of an entire genre, rap/hip hop. From The Sugarhill Gang's maiden flagship, ""Rapper's Delight"" to 2013's Daft Punk's ""Around the World"". It has been the sound bed for everything from Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust"", Blondie's ""Rapture"" to Wham's ""Wham's Rap"".\nIt is the seminal sampled track that will undoubtedly be in the Grammy Hall of Fame and even the National Library of Congress."

The rest of the songs range from come ons to girls to typical contempary R&B sounds of bragging, sex, etc. Nothing really new. I guess you could say that his last album before this (not counting the one he did with Bow Wow),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21/dp/B000H30BW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21</a>&nbsp;was in a similar vein. HOWEVER, although ""21"" talked about sex too mostly it had bangin', current beats to accompany the songs. That is the difference that ultimately makes this more mediocre than his last solo project.\n\nSo in the end, this project unlike ""21"" is pretty skip-able. There aren't really any money tracks at all although if you like your typical topics of R&B in 2010 and beyond, you might be right at home with this album. All I know is that he's capable of more.\n\n3 stars."

""Groove Jazz N Chill #3"" from the ""Chillaxing Jazz Kollektion"" features the relaxing sounds of the prolific, globe-trotting 'smooth jazz' composer, arranger, producer and saxophonist Konstantin Klastorni. It has jazzy, relaxing, swinging music with an exotic sound and hypnotic beats. The vibe of the first track ""Nothing Without You"" sets the mood for the entire recording as he mixes in a variety of smooth acoustic and electronic sounds over an infectious beat, mixing in guitars, keyboards, and saxes which trade leads. But he 'ups the ante' with the laid back beauty of ""Inside You"" with the 'call-response' of sax and guitar. Other outstanding tracks include ""Every Good Thing"", the soothing mixture of synth and guitar on ""Like A River"", the funky flutes, synth, and guitar on ""Beautiful Day"", the arian-sounds of ""That's Life"", the oriental sound of ""Good Morning"" and the floating sax notes of ""Blue Pacific"".

"11945","5","","B00GHG5524","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Perfect Imperfection"" is the debut solo album by guitarist/composer Tom Carleno, but this is hardly the beginning of his music career. Carleno has been performing with his acoustic jazz ensemble, Perpetual Motion, for more than twenty-five years and has recorded five albums with them. ""Perfect Imperfection"" is a real showcase for Carlenos varied and passionate style of acoustic guitar playing and composing. A retrospective of eleven songs composed over the past twenty-five years and recorded over a four-year period, the pieces range from the serene Meet Me in Maui to covers of Al Stewarts On the Border and John Lennons Imagine to Childs Play, a spirited duet for guitar and spoons, and Rhapsody in Blood, Carlenos homage to the horror films of the 1930s and 40s - complete with sound effects! A master of his instrument, Carleno tells stories without words and paints vivid pictures without a canvas, sharing experiences and having fun in the process.\n\nThe album begins with In Search Of, a piece that Carleno says seemed to be trying to find its own way as he was writing it, sometimes going in different directions than he expected. Easy-going and relaxed, its a great opening. Meet Me in Maui is in memory of Carlenos mother, who also loved to vacation in Maui. Very tranquil and calming, it feels like a warm breeze blowing over a peaceful ocean. Beautiful! On the Border is one of Al Stewarts classic signature pieces. Originally released in 1976, Carlenos cover version is a great tribute to the British rocker! The graceful Timberline Tree was inspired by a painting by Carlenos mother, Joan Hagen Carleno. The piece is gorgeous, and a copy of the painting graces the back of the CD cover. I love Childs Play, a  playful and lighthearted duet for guitar and spoons (performed by Carlenos wife, Josie Quick). Rhapsody in Blood is a trip! Inspired by the spooky soundtracks for early horror films, this 6 1/2-minute tour de force includes some great sound effects, many (all???) of which were created on the guitar - creaking doors, howling wolves, bone-chilling screams, thunder, and other sounds of dark foreboding. From there, we go to the gentle simplicity of Lennons classic Imagine - an exceptionally nice arrangement! Brief Encounter was Carlenos first finger-style composition, written in 1985, and What a Difference a Day Makes is a lovely new piece composed specifically for this album.\n\n""Perfect Imperfection"" is a wonderful album that is excellent for focused listening as well as in the background. Well, Rhapsody in Blood isn't too good as background music, but the rest of the tunes are! Great stuff!"

Never mind the fact that her self titled 3rd LP ""Debby Boone"" is, in my opinion, a pop vocal classic (""I'd Rather Be Alone"" is a classic in and of itself, but her version of ""Choosey Beggar"" is an alltime favorite of mine!) or that her country remakes showed a talent bigger than her one-hit-wonder status, Debby was the squeaky-clean religious daughter of Pat Boone and nothing was going to change that.  How sad she records so little and how sad we miss out on hearing more of those amazing vocals on a variety of genres.  We turned our backs, basically stating that nobody wanted to hear from her again.  Oh, how wrong we were.\n\nBut, lucky for us who have been paying attention, as Debby recorded music last year which is both fun, flashy and yeah, pretty darn fantastic.\n\nUptempo tunes show Debby's fun side, which (I think) few people think she has.  The most fun for me is ""Get Me To The Church On Time"", ""Sway"" and a jazzy/swinging version of ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"".  But once again it's Debby's voice on ballads such as ""Cry Me A River"" and ""More Than You Know"" that sets my heart a-flutter.  She's sounds as crystal clear and darn near perfect on these songs as she did 37 years ago, showing true talent endures through the ages.  Simply put: BEAUTIFUL!!\n\n(The only slight hic-cup for me is a version of ""Mack The Knife"", which in my opinion truly suits a males voice a bit better than a females.  So, it's more of a song choice than an issue with the vocal.  This song, however, no way effects the CD as a whole or it's well deserved 5 star rating.)\n\nNow, however, comes the painful task of waiting years upon years for another wonderful masterpiece from this talented singer.  Let's hope NOT!!!"

Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails."

However, both also do suffer from a hard flow that sometimes does not go over their beats well.\n\nJones' album suffers from an uneven flow, and his track beats are a little weak in my opinion. I was not eye-popped by any of the tracks on this album; they were all listenable and ok. The best of the bunch were Your City, Kingdom Figures and WOG, but Mouthpiece and Bizzle really bailed the first two songs out.\n\nOverall this project was ok. If you really like Christian Hip Hop, you can pick it up. Maybe it will sound better to you, like it did for these other reviewers. For me, I wasn't dissappointed, but I wasn't impressed either."

Of all the songs on that CD, this one stuck out the most.  It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.\n\nI've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future."

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

"13110","4","","B00IRL4P14","a45c12552902da6b583215beb62686f8MB6L","Shinedowns vocalist Brent Smith and guitarist Zach Myers strip down and unplug to cover several classics and their choices are surprising and broad ranging from contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You), old school 80s rock (Phil Collins slow-build In the Air Tonight and Bon Jovis classic Wanted Dead Or Alive), and Seattle grunge (Pearl Jams Black).  For some reason they decided to split up their Acoustic Sessions into two parts and the first entry  is even more diversified but if I had to pick a favorite between the two I would go with this second, shorter session due to the strength of the Adele coververy moving and strong and I don't even listen to Adele; does anyone else want to see these two maybe perform a duet?and PJs impassioned tune.  I was surprised that my least favorite track was the one I anticipated being my favorite as I have always really enjoyed the slow-burn power of In the Air Tonight but with the percussion and in spite of their best efforts to provide that rising punch its just not there.  There are ten songs over the two releases and this second release accounts for four of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward."

However, when I bought ""Fire on the Mountain"", I decided I wanted ""Can't You See"" and ""Heard it in a Love Song"" as well. Still, I couldn't convince myself to buy the greatest hits album. If you like Marshall Tucker's studio work, which is all I really know, then you'll like this version. If you want something else, probably go with the ""live"" album they have available."

Calling his music atmospheric music takes it in a somewhat different direction from new age or ambient because its both and yet neither from a purist standpoint. With elements of prog rock, the album features Luttrell on acoustic and electric guitars as well as keyboards with twelve songs that follow the theme of exchanging dreams. In the liner notes, Luttrell explains: Throughout our lives we share our dreams with family and friends, and they share their dreams with us. If we're lucky we can help them activate and achieve their dreams and also work on achieving our own. How wonderful it is to experience and share in this Dream Exchange. A lifelong musician who has lived and absorbed cultural influences from all over the world, Luttrells music reflects many of these influences and gives him a very distinctive sound.\n\n""The Dream Exchange"" begins with Orange Sky, a piece that combines dreamy atmospheric sounds with a gently-floating guitar melody and a lively rhythm that comes and goes - a very effective opening! The Sphere contains a variety of styles and is possibly one of the more prog rock pieces. From Hawaiian guitar to electric rock guitar over ambient musical and atmospheric sounds, it has no hard edges while continuously evolving as it develops. Dreamcast is a favorite. Slow and graceful with a shimmering beauty, it reminds me of watching a sunset by the ocean. The title track opens with the sound of rain and thunder and then the electric guitar enters, evoking images of the sun breaking through the storm clouds. From there, guitars express tones of peaceful calm and tranquility - also a favorite. I love the title Somnambulistic Journey, and the misty, dreamy music is the perfect accompaniment to a peaceful sleepwalking expedition. Ethereal Raga combines a catchy rhythm and mysterious ambient sounds to create colorful images that dance slowly in atmospheric clouds - fascinating! Inland Returned is light and fanciful with acoustic and electric guitars leading the way with a gentle smile. With You brings the album to a close with an easy, swaying rhythm and feelings of blissful contentment.\n\n""The Dream Exchange"" is quiet, relaxing music with plenty of substance to hold your interest while letting your imagination fly. Recommended!"

It has been a very long while since she came out with new songs. The past few years set the motion of her music failing and more about her feuds between Nicki Minaj, and the decision of firing her as a judge on American Idol. Her latest set of songs, do fail to ignite on her new record Me... I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse. Thirsty, the next single from wasted album shows that Mariah still is missing the mark at heart and in voice as well. I really found the song to be even worse than even all the songs she had released from her last album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel. She definitely needs to find better in her voice, and her heart. Hopefully, there will be better from her to quench your thirst in her voice.\n\nSong: D+"

Naturally, I wanted to purchase Glow but it was not yet available for purchase, so I went with an intuitive feeling to get Ghost.  Ghost is also a song that draws a listener in because she is singing about someone who has left an impact on her and is singing about her though process of trying to figure out how to best deal with it. Henderson also carefully projects her voice during the song in a way that conveys she is really putting all of her spirit and emotion to the song.

Im one of the millions of kids who grew up with the original trilogy. I ran around with chopsticks taped to my back as you do when you're 4, pretending to be a ninja turtle. The turtles have been revamped before, and not too long ago hit theaters as an animated feature. The great thing about this ever-lasting franchise is that they have no musical identity (maybe the original TV theme song and Vanilla Ice sadly) so it becomes an open canvas for a composer. I mean, how many of you remember John Du Prezs scores for the original trilogy? Or even Klaus Badelts awesome score for TMNT in 2007? The scores worked in the moment, but never became attached to these characters, and this allowed for Tyler to build a simply damn awesome orchestral action score from scratch.\n\nBrian Tyler reunites with director Jonathan Liebesman for their fourth feature together here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is simply just a fantastic orchestral approach to the typical summer studio tentpole. Everything about this score moves with fluidity, intensity, awe and a warm heroic glow. A simple theme acts as the lifeline of the score. It carries the weight of the films much larger action scope with ease. It can turn one way and feel heavy and dramatic, but it can also flip to be uplifting and heroic. Tyler affectionately refers to it as the TMNT March. The whole score is nothing really complicated, it propels the action and gives it an old school adventure vibe. Parts of it reminded me of Jerry Goldsmiths The Mummy, it had that kind of adventure spirit. Some parts also reminded me of Hans Zimmers Man Of Steel, mostly Zimmers main theme and the track Terraforming. Tylers action writing is not too different from Zimmer though, they do approach things similarly which is fun because their stylistic approaches are very different. Even if there was a little case of temp track hangover, Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is its own fun ride. Its melodically charged and gives the film a big adrenaline rush without being contrived or unnecessarily loud. The flow of the adventure is so smooth, and with long tracks you get a feel for the scores structure. The theme is used a lot, but I never got a one-note type feel. The only thing lacking is some emotional and structural depth.\n\nBrian Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is all types of fun. Its a great action score done in that great orchestral fashion that Tyler is known for. A simple theme holds the dramatic weight of the film, plus adds heroic flare. You won't find deep emotions or anything much beyond the main theme, but thats all the score needs to do here. There are plenty of great moments, superb action builds and the music flows with ease. The score delivers all that you need in order to watch this incarnation of the turtles fighting the baddies in an action extravaganza.\n\nKaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.com"

In the album, he deals with how he has evolved with hip hop over the years, his having to overcome obstacles in and out of the music business, and even his recent weight loss and lifestyle change to increased physical fitness. Joell Ortiz is obviously in a healthy place in life, considering the fact that he is performing this self examination with a grateful attitude. He is still that creative, hard edged emcee who raps with advanced lyricism. And for every filler track on House Slippers, there are three or four intelligent tracks to make up for them. In other words, the bulk of the album is made up of smart material. Ortiz has invited some rappers and some singers to appear on House Slippers and has even brought his Slaughterhouse group mates (Royce Da 5'9'', Joe Budden, and Crooked I) into the studio for ""Brothers Keeper"" to show that besides being a rap quartet, they are also a family. The production is handled mainly by The Heatmakerz and gives the album a sparkling yet rugged sound. This time around, Joell Ortiz is a more self aware artist who spits fire on the mic over nice hip hop beats. House Slippers is a good addition to his growing body of work."

"14935","4","","B00MU2S93G","4d1373613dabf727cedc8e2b4c6b5ea1ERCM","A little past the due date, this review serves to put the spotlight back on a shining beacon of an album, March On Washington. Released in October 2014 by hip hop trio Diamond District (producer Oddisee and emcees yU and Uptown XO) under Mello Music Group, March On Washington just might be the perfect album to reserve for February, Black History Month, to review. Although it doesn't explicitly make race an issue, this crystalline-bright LP, inspired by the event during which Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous I Have A Dream speech, has a sense of vigor and urgency that mimic the 1963 civil rights gathering which it is named after. When the three artists on the album wear their Black pride on their sleeves however, they do so with a good measure of modesty. Boiled down, March On Washington is simply amazing music for all people, irrespective of skin tone. You could listen to this beautiful album a dozen times and still need more plays to capture and appreciate all the gifts it intends to bestow upon its listeners. It's that good.\n\nOddisee, yU and XO hail from the Washington DC area, or the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) as some call it. They're not shy about representing their area with pride, but they're also not obsessed with the practice either thankfully. March On Washington is basically a clarion call to live healthfully. The album's wisdom easily takes the cake, and this wisdom is not the boring, snooze-inducing type but the cool, useful, knowledge-based sort aided of course by a preponderance of superlative rap flows by yU and XO. Each stanza flourishes with excellent lyrical rhymes and undisturbed thoughts on everyday life. Areas explored include the differences among people, critique of the mainstream and lots of bubbly, effervescent proverbs. Diamond District wish to share their preternatural skill, talent and ways of thinking, and the richness and captivating nature of March On Washington prove the group's success to this end. The album is smart but also fun, never losing its lyrical weightiness. The ride is smooth yet hypnotic, as everything rests comfortably on Oddisee's soul-drenched samples and crisp drum set beats. Look out for a few surprises like ""Working Weekends""' squeaky, chirpy alt. sounds. The variety they provide will come in handy.\n\nAlthough only their second album as a group following 2009's In The Ruff, Diamond District have the hip hop heart and substance to make them instant breakout hit makers. Each of the three members are proving themselves singly with outside projects, but together they might be even more special. March On Washington is exciting and philosophical, with lots of slow-bopping replay value that is street tested and boom-bap approved."

I love Two Steps from Hell, and Thomas Bergersen's previous album ""Illusions"" was magnificent (10 stars for that one).  This one sounded better in the 30-sec previews; I found it has a very tribal quality (due to the vocals) upon listening to the tracks all the way through.  It's in my writing playlist rotation, as I don't think it's a bad album...it's just not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it's grown on me the more I've listened to it - one of those cases of familiarity breeding enjoyment.  I don't regret my purchase; this is one I might have delayed, however, if I'd had the forethought to listen to it on YouTube.  While ""Illusions"" remains a masterful work with infinite replay value, ""Sun"" is more a mood thing and one I don't find myself reaching to play as often."

It has always has seemed to me, that each compilation released, has been thoughtful in its sequencing,to eventually create a unique listening experience. And more importantly , that the artist was present.  The same could be said for Nothing Has Changed. The reversed chronology of the album, and the different versions , plus the bonus or unreleased material , makes this required  Bowie listening for the die hard and the novice. This is not a schlock-y, hastily put together, jukebox-y collection of single edits for mass appeal. It's a thoughtful walk with Bowie through his entire career, and the many moods, and aural experiments we we were privileged to hear."

Some of the albums are not my type of music and so I don't have them, but that certainly my personal taste in music doesn't determine their quality or value.\n\nBach Guild seems to be fairly responsive to fixing errors in the songs. I do have one SUGGESTION FOR BACH GUILD: Run your MP3s through MP3gain (can be found for free at Sourceforge) and they will all be the same volume.  This is what I do (89.0 dB) immediately upon downloading my new albums, however for those who choose to stream from Amazon you have to deal with the constant volume changes until Amazon adds volume normalization.  Bach Guild also seems to be doing a good job at filling out the Metadata properly:  Song title, Artist (who performed it).  I just have to add ""Composer"" which takes 5 seconds."

This song, released the same year, won some awards and a US Grammy nomination as far as I recall. I like the style and the musical flow of this tune. Yes, one can hear elements stemming from the 'Genesis' style, but different enough to make it unique. I always liked this song a lot. I still do.

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's ""Forget Him"" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again."

She sadly passed away 3 1/2 years ago, but the heart and soul of her beautiful and enchanting voice had never lost its luster, while she did lose her own soul in singing, largely from every lampooning her and abusing her to death, as the ""Crack Is Whack"" joke, and not looking at whom she had been as a delightful human being. Now, with thinking of Whitney Houston's passing, and the recent passing of her one and only baby Bobbi Kristina Brown, I am constantly reminded of the deep sadness, and sincerity she left behind in each and every note she sung from her beloved heart. I Look To You remains a dominant example, hearing the song for the first time as we were all dealing with the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, and at the same day of his funeral, I really was so reminded of when a voice and song can deeply hit you, and this song really hit the nail on the head. R. Kelly really wrote a masterpiece for Whitney Houston, and if you had never heard a song she had recorded, than you must download this song.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012\n\nSong: A+"

In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.\n\nAll of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.\n\nWords Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After ""Promise Land,"" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven ""originals."" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric ""Blakk Soul"" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in ""Kings.""\n\nIt would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty."

'Red moon rising' and 'Red moon calling' actually beckoning the listener with the arrangement. I loved 'Glimmer of light' and could visualise shades slowly brightening, building up and shining through!!! 'Notions astir' too has a lot of sparks of enlightenment- like ideas springing up, leading to a bit of confusion and doubt sometimes but flourishing in the end...just as one goes through when the spark of an idea has to be taken through to realisation   Fantastic music!!"

I recently decided to give Audiomachine ""Life"" a chance. I enjoyed several of the pieces. But I knew that was a lighter album and wanted to hear something that represented Audiomachine's more characteristic style and sound. I randomly chose Magnus this morning and have been listening to to most of the day. All I can say is I am amazed how good the music. I feel silly for waiting so long to try them out. Some of the pieces that really stand out to me as captivating and amazing at this point include Frozen Synapse, When it all Falls Down, Being Alive, Red October...these are the ones I appreciate so much just after one day. If you like epic music such as Two Steps from Hell, don't be a noob like me, buy this album.\n\nEdit: after listening for about a week I can say there are no duds on this album, every piece is exceptionally good and captivating. I cannot believe I waited so long to check out Audiomachine. Buy now. Bye now!"
"17710","5","","B00YRDOGKQ","bf6338a70a154d69217462cf75871768D0Z3","Last week I found another phenomenal classical music bargain at Amazon.com: Haydn: Complete String Quartets on the VoxBox label. Featuring the Dekany Quartet and the Fine Arts Quartet, this splendid MP3 album contains nearly 24 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns string quartets, all brilliantly performed by the two ensembles mentioned above.\n\nThis MP3 VoxMegaBox Edition contains all of the string quartets in Haydns oeuvre, including some that are credited to him that he may not have composed. The works are placed in opus number order, from earliest to latest, so listeners can hear the progression of Haydns musical thinking and development over his many decades of composing in this genre.\n\nThe Dekany Quartet plays just over half of the 70-plus works that appear on this album, and the Fine Arts Quartet plays the remainder. The musicianship of these two ensembles is exquisite throughout. They consistently engage their instruments in those finely balanced musical conversations that make well-played string quartets such a joyful listening experience for me. Their interpretations are flawless, showing every bit of the emotion and intellect that Haydn wrote into each one of his chamber music masterworks. There are some subtle differences between the two ensembles in tone, texture, and color, but overall, I find it difficult to tell them apart.\n\nThe audio quality on Haydn: Complete String Quartets is crisp, clean, and precise. My ears can easily detect each of the four lines playing in every string quartet. On rare occasions, the first violin sounds a trifle over-bright, but this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Haydn: Complete String Quartets first came out at Amazon.com in 2015, it apparently sold for $2.99  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at over three times that price ($9.49), I think it remains one of the best classical music values to be found anywhere. Its low price, combined with its exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality, makes it a must-have in every digital classical music library. Most highly recommended."

He honestly has been one of the greatest singer/songwriters in regards to R&B music. Yet, he has been absent from making decent music for quite awhile. He came back from a long absence from making music for himself in regards to good music. He came back with Toni Braxton a few years ago, and they both released Love, Marriage & Divorce, which wasn't a bad record for the two of them. But for himself, he has needed to write better for his solo work. We've Got Love, which is the lead single from his latest album, Return Of The Tender Lover, isn't a bad song for die hard Babyface buffs, but overall not a must download for new fans of his music. The song does show his style nobly but not really anything to thrive into that ""wow, I must own this song"" factor. Still, he has had great songs before, like When Can I See You Again. But overall, there can be better from Babyface down the road.\n\nSong: C+"

I had a musical epiphany because I was really locked in to Paul's bass. It was almost like I was hearing it for the first time, especially on the fade out chorus. I'd always appreciated his playing, but this time it really hit me how great it truly is.\nI love when John's vocals take on that faraway hue on 'cellophane flowers...', it's like OK, Dorothy opened the door from her black and white world and entered the colorful land of Oz. Well, in this song, we start out already in Oz and on the cellophane part we open a door into an even more amazing land - John's imagination! This is psychedelic pop at its best.

"19334","3","3","B01BQ7NRV4","4d1373613dabf727cedc8e2b4c6b5ea1ERCM","Why does Joell Ortiz have to make it so hard for us to wait for a new Slaughterhouse album? Putting out nice albums like his latest, That's Hip Hop, makes it even harder. You can tell how great he would sound in the group again because his rhyme game is so tight here, and after all, he's obviously been working on it continuously. The Brooklyn backpack bomber comes off of 2014's House Slippers and 2015's Human with Illmind for this very retro, throwback-themed project, and it's got a lot of hardcore rap cats on it just doing their thing, with production that is true-to-the-pit boom bap. That's Hip Hop was released Tuesday, March 15 on the record label of the same name.\n\nThe album was clearly designed with the pure rap/rhyme addicts in mind. Like a typical Joell Ortiz set, it is not loaded with messages and really only aims towards a social end when Jo describes his urban N.Y.C. milieu and community across a handful of songs, when he tells a woman's sob story for her in ""Precious"" and when he tells some of his own war stories of hard times in ""Trouble."" Everything else is pretty much a lyrics-fest. Experienced, respected guys like Kool G Rap, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. start that good golden-era fire, and some neo-shine is cast by new jewels like Raven Felix, Chris Rivers and Token, the last of whom has a very double-edged verse in ""Kill at Will"" - it's very fast, very nimble and very impressive delivery-wise, but as insane rap mouthpieces tend to do, the search for meaning and message gets lost in his ravishing rapacious technique.\n\nJoell's well tuned machine-mouth works just fine here, but those offensive, shockingly controversial bits and pieces that all hip-hop heads know, love and look for are few in That's Hip Hop. Without making striking statements that are anti-status quo or anti-establishment, like he should, he depends on his striking yet easy obscenities and profanities to turn heads. And it was just like this on his last two albums as well. Many of us look to talented and skilled emcees like Joell to spread awareness about the world's problems, but sadly there's too little of that in the correct form here. Technically, Joell Ortiz is a beast and so are his features, and the producers have properly and impressively fashioned their beats into that vintage '90s style of hip-hop production, but if you're looking for new enlightening messages, you may not want to spend a lot of time on this disc."

There were 4 more bonus tracks available on the DVD, which were downloadable, for a total of 29 songs. Phil thought that was too many songs, so for this 2016 remaster, he retitled the album ""The Essential Going Back"" and trimmed it down to 14 songs. This is a blunder in my view, no matter how he justifies it. Especially with 2 CDs to fill up. The other 15 songs could have (and should have) been somewhere on this collection, even if they were weaker than the 14 songs he chose to keep (which will be a matter of opinion to each listener). It's sort of like ""Coda"" by Led Zeppelin. The last album, and weakest one, but one you still need to complete your collection. The songs here aren't terrible, the production is great and if I could describe the performances in one word, it would be ""perfunctory."""

I will say that the bowl is very pretty and looks like it will hold up well for a small dog. But I don't have a small dog, so I'm just going to donate this rather than go through the hassle of a return.\n\nMy dog eats 1 cup of kibble per meal, so a 2-cup bowl should have been plenty. (She is a medium-sized dog, so she has to be able to get her muzzle in the bowl, too.) The wide rim means that the actual bowl area is narrower. And as far as holding 2 cups of kibble? Yeah, maybe when it grows up. I've attached a pic of the bowl with 2 measured cups of kibble done with a kitchen measuring cup. (And the tag on the bottom of the bowl appears to say ""1.26 cups"" and ""10 oz."" Hard to say for sure because the print is partly rubbed off.)

I did briefly switch to Taste of the Wild, which is grain-free...but he did not seem to grow as well on it (the puppy version), and also he tends to have issues with his anal glands so he needs some grain to help bulk that up.\n\nRecently I did a second research of puppy foods to get some ideas on getting him to gain a little extra weight, because he is picky and while he likes this food, he wasn't eating quite enough of it.  After studying nutrition on most of the main high quality foods, I came back to this one, although Prairie seems to be a little more expensive even than some of the other high quality foods.  I did notice this food has more calories per cup than most of the other puppy foods, which is good, in my opinion, because it means you are getting more ""food"" per cup than other foods.\n\nWe did solve the pickiness by mixing just a small scoop of an all-natural canned food with his kibble and some warm water, and he eats it up!  We've been using Prairie since we brought him home at 8 weeks old, and other than the one bag of Taste of the Wild, we have been satisifed enough with this food to keep buying it, and we will probably switch to the adult kind later on.  This kibble does not cause him any gas (although most canned foods do...we found one that seems not to so far, so we'll see) and allows him to have well-formed stools, and it is all-natural.\n\nDefinitely recommend."

I have 2 boxes set up (my original litter robot, and the booda dome) with this litter, and even my litter robot stinks (only my old cat uses my robot, as the new one doesn't know what to think of it)!!! It really does not clump very well either (maybe not being able to get all of the pee out, is one reason for the stink). I do not know how all these good reviews have come about, but from someone who DOES NOT like their house to smell of cat box, I will NOT be buying this stuff again!! It is WAY more expensive than regular clumping litter, and it is not much better than using regular clay in my opinion. Maybe others will have better results, but I will go back to buying my tried and true clumping litter and NOT have a house that smells like I have 20 cats living in it. Clay clumping litter costs less, works better...no brainer here!"

Preferring more natural products, this one sounded very good.  The time came to test it when my old dog left a trail of soft poopies on a hallway rug.

Rawhide is the inner layer of the hide of any cleft-hoofed bovine livestock. Beef-Hide is premium rawhide made from cows raised for consumption. So, this is just another form of rawhide that is from cows as opposed to just any animal with a cleft hoof.  The Healthy hide rawhide has some extra potato starch, salt, soybean oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and preservatives.  The Healthy Hide sticks have almost ZERO SMELL.\n\nSIZE:  These are really small pencil sized rawhide treats (see pictures) and are too small for my 45 pound dog (medium size dog).

The Healthy hide sticks come with 20 sticks but they smell like plain old rawhide and my dog just leaves it lying around.

None of my dogs (I have 3 between 4 pounds and almost 8 pounds) come close to fitting this harness in EXTRA small.  The 8 pounder is actually a tubby but he was still swimming in this one.  Either way because it was so cheap I decided not to bother by sending it back and cut out the strap with the clip and D-rings on the back, made the side straps a little longer (I had them all the way short) and now use it while hooking my leash clip to the O-rings that holds the straps to the harness.  It fits perfect and even better than before since my escape artist can't wiggle his way out now!\nThe purple shown on the pic is actually much darker and the piping is a real dark purple instead of the blueish purple it appears to be.

They are American made. Smell good to my dog. Do not feel like jerky and are easy to chew up, nothing to get stuck. Just the right size for my small dog (Havanese). And he is very picky about what he eats (like people) but happens to like these (as of 12-3-14 he ignores these and wants only Stweart's liver treats, or Rocco and Roxie jerky treats, he can tell by the bag or the sound of it hitting the floor). I think he just knows there are better treats if he turns these down. There is no guarrantee yours will like these but it is worth a try for your cat or dog. (My dog refuses free dog biscuits at the drive-up bank windows and treats I thought he would like so they go to the animal shelter). Recommended product (just a picky dog) and I hope this helps someone."

I like that this dog food is formulated specifically for large breed puppies as they have unique needs. Growing too fast or putting on weight too fast can be hard on their growing joints/body, so it's good to have a formula that allows them to get the nutrients they need without packing on the weight too fast. Of course, none of that matters if your puppy won't eat the food. This food was a hit at our house. She had to be fed away from the other dogs as they were trying to steal the food."

Products Fleece Pet Bed, Brown Plaid, 36 by 45-Inch.\n\nThis Dallas Manufacturing Co fleece pet bed is a good bed with a few caveats.  First of all 36-Inch by 45-Inch is the size of the cover when it is flat with nothing in it.  This sides are not box cut, so some inches are lost upon stuffing.  With the stuffing in there as sold by Brinkman Pet Products, it measures more like 32 inches by 42 inches.  The cover comes off for easy washing.  The interior cushioning is inside an interior zippered case so that you can add or remove to get the stuffing level you like.  The stuffing is Eco-first recycled fiber fill.  When my 100 pound puppy or I sit on it, we go straight to sitting on the floor with fluffy cushion all around us.  The material is soft on both sides.  This pet bed is attractive and comfortable with either side up.  The fabric on both sides is thicker and heavier weight than many other pet beds so it might hold up better to biters.  Both of my dogs do love this pet bed and I have uploaded photos of my 100 pound Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy for you to see how he looks on the 36 x 45 inch(more like 32 x 42) bed."

This food is quite a bit cheaper with some other pet food sellers, but they require you mail a prescription in or have your vet fax one, which can be a bit of a hassle."

I have tried dozens of treats to try and get him to chew and scrape off plaque and keep his teeth nice. He basically only likes chipped rawhide (which I avoid usually due to choking hazard and low production quality), True Chews Lils bully sticks, and True Chews pig ears.  These ears are made in the US from US-sourced (Tyson brand) meat. They are very greasy, so I bought a clean new pair of pruning shears and cut them in half. They usually don't cause digestive issues and my pup chows down on them. He is 18 lbs and it takes him less than 30 minutes to eat half of one.\n\nYou might be able to find pig ears cheaper, but since these are made in the US I perceive them to be safer and will pay more."

I read up on some ingredients that could potentially encourage the growth of yeast, and I came across sweet potatoes. While I am not a veterinatian, I did read that sweet potatoes are high in sugar and can encourage yeast to grow. So I tried Nutrisca out since it was one of the only Potato-Free options. I figured why not try to eliminate it and see what happens?\n\nMy pup has been on this food for two months and we haven't had a single ear yeast infection. He was on the brand Merrick before that which was very high in protein and lots of sweet potato recipies. It's very hard to tell if it was the food or not, but I'm most definitely happy to not see an ear infection every other week on my dog. I think the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I feel that they need more recipes. Salmon, Lamb, and Chicken are the only options. Would love to see a beef or turkey recipe."

After I ceased feeding my cats Royal Canin products, the one cat started regaining her weight, and still is and all the hair missing on the other's tummy, has fully grown back in. I need no further proof of the danger feeding this brand to my cats will cause.\n\nI dislike writing a negative review, it is not my style, for any product. However, in this case I must. I have a responsibility to other cat lovers to do so. I would hope they would do the same to protect my pet food choices. I used Royal Canin for a number of years without any issues. Then something changed and their health issues began surfacing and it had to be the Royal Canin. My cats have always been fed quality cat foods, dry and wet. They often eat better than I do or so it feels at times.\n\nAs with foods I consume, sometimes formulas, recipes or ingredients are changed slightly just enough to throw product quality off. It's always about the bottom line and profits while the consumer and their pets pay a price. There had to be some shift in the quality of the RC brand and I can not give this product more than one star. I would offer no stars if I could. I have bags of this brand leftover and instead of feeding it to my cats as not to waste money, I will either donate to the local animal shelter or discard. I'm leaning toward discarding it as I don't wish the animals at the shelter being negatively affected by the brand either. Even though shelters are always in need of pet foods. Maybe I will check with those in charge to ask their thoughts on the issue.\n\nAnd whatever you do get your cats off Fancy Feast canned foods. That brand was all one of my other cats(deceased) would eat and she died of cancer so I know that brand using some pretty awful ingredients. I wasn't as savvy then about quality foods as I am now. I remember though the odd smell of that cat food every time I opened a new can. But she didn't ever turn it down. She had one favorite flavor which eludes me right now.

My vet said it was likely a Seborrheic dermatitis (I didn't want to pay for a scraping and lab) and he suggested a tar based shampoo. Apparently it is not uncommon in young adult dogs and especially the big ones like mine.  I contacted my breeder who is devoted to natural products and supplements and she suggested that I get this shampoo and the associated conditioner and use it once a week (twice the first week). I bought a small bottle locally (and it was quite expensive) and the stuff really made a huge difference.  Only two weeks in and most of his spots are gone and his coat looks gorgeous (I believe the conditioner has much to do with the shine!).  Amazon's price is exceptional and I suspect this will be a staple ""go to"" shampoo/conditioner combo for my dogs. This stuff smells nice too!"

However, following exploratory abdominal & stomach surgery for having eaten something he shouldn't, I needed a muzzle which my big guy could wear at home, alone. With this muzzle, he can drink & I can easily give him treats. To make him happier with it, I've been trying to associate it with fun stuff, like going for runs. He can wear it on a run & is able to pant, to lick his nose, etc. It protrudes far enough in front of his nose & mouth that he can't eat grass or anything else he might want to grab. He seems completely comfortable with this muzzle. I highly recommend it. It does look like a big wire basket. I've had many dogs, some of whom have needed muzzles in stressful situations or to get acquainted with new members of the family. This is the most dog-friendly muzzle I've had. I've thought about painting it black, but don't want to risk toxic paint."

Since I am using this to keep him from licking himself, I did have to modify it a bit so that he couldn't get his tongue through the bottom bars that run from under his chin to his neck so that he couldn't get his tongue through and lick that way and now HE CANNOT LICK!!! I am so happy because he has chewed on himself for the first time and caused a horrible sore. My vet had suggested a cone of shame but I find this muzzle way more humane. He can drink, play and function without bumping into anything and isn't acting sad like I have seen with dogs who do wear a cone of shame. Since this is something he's going to have to wear for a while, I am extremely happy and my dog seems to be too."

"536723","4","","B00CZ9Q17A","a8336cd9ce07c84c2559149c4610b7e3EVBL","----------------------------Update on the robosnail ---------------------------------\nContacted Robosnail about the unit. Have to say I'm very impressed with the follow up. He stayed in constant contact with me checking back on how the unit was performing. Finally determined it was a bad unit and he sent another which arrived quickly. The new unit doesn't creep downward at all and works great!! Very happy with this device! Keeps glass nice and clean. Hoping the next version will do more than one pass because it will miss a few spots but thats going to happen with any of these type devices unless they make at least 2 passes when cleaning. Even with the missed spots they are very small and really you cant even notice them from outside the glass its only when you look at the inside of the glass form the side of the tank. Its not that it misses the same spots over and over its just when it cleans there may be a section here or there that gets missed but most likely was cleaned on last cleaning therefore its not bad. Either way as stated customer service has been outstanding and the unit works beautifully! Now I can just sit back and enjoy my tank and when Im too busy with work I don't have to worry about coming home to algae covering the glass (at least not on the front anyway) I still have to leave it at 4 stars bc of the price but I if I could Id give it a 4.9 rating. Its really nice and you won't be disappointed with this investment! Got high hopes for ver 2.0!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAt first I wrote a pretty ugly review about the robosnail. Wasn't too happy because I thought I received the smaller unit. Apparently even though the model number shows the smaller unit they have upgraded these to the larger units (for .5 inch glass) The problem is nowhere in the packaging does it state this. Apparently it's just a golden Circle put on the box. That said I was very aggravated in the beginning thinking they sent me the wrong one but after contacting their customer service I found that it is the correct size. My glass is half inch thick and 6 ft long. I set it up and for the most part it works fine. I did have to take some clear tape and put it on my left edge but I use the clear boxing tape and put about a half inch strip down the left Edge. At first I wasn't too crazy about this but honestly the only reason I see it is because I know it's there. I even had my wife stare at that side of the tank for 10 minutes trying to figure out what I did and she never saw the tape. It sounds kind of cheap to have to put tape on there but honestly you're not going to see it. That said the good is the unit seems to work well and keep everything clean. As long as it runs once a day the algae never really builds up. I would still clean the Velcro on the inside piece to keep anything like coralline algae from building up on it and scratching the glass. The bad is it somewhat bulky and the design isn't the prettiest in the world but it's not horrible by any means. For $250 I do think it's overpriced. It could have been smaller and Slicker looking and had a few other features but as usual when something's first rolled out it never seems to be top of the line. It's what you would expect from the first of its kind. On a 6ft long tank it's not that big of a deal because you're only talking 4 inches in the right hand corner but if it was a smaller tank I would probably have to say it would be a little bit more noticeable. Again if it was smaller and neater looking no one would care but it's kind of large and bulky. It does have a light on the front of it that stays on 24/7 but while some people have complained about it I don't really see a problem with it. That's probably the only thing that looks neat in my opinion. I don't like that it has to be mounted on the right-hand corner of the tank I would much prefer to have the option to go on either side. I also don't like that it can't be programmed for specific times but instead you have to hit the button and then it runs every 12 hours from that point. I also had to put tape on the right side below the docking unit because with it tracking back 6ft sometimes it slipped too far down but after talking to customer service it ended up just being the wheels needing cleaned. They still had a little oil from the manufacturer which caused it to lose traction and drop about an inch as it traveled back to the docking station. Since I clean the wheels everything has been fine. On a couple of occasions for whatever reason it seemed to keep pushing on the edge instead of stopping. When it continued to push it eventually fail. Got to say I have hardwood floors and one of the nice things about it being so bulky is it can take a beating because it fell a good 4 feet and didn't even scratch it. Also I should note this was before I added the tape. It hasn't fallen since then so far for the last week it's worked perfect. I would also make sure your glass is perfectly clean before you set it up. It does great keeping the glass clean but if you let the algae build up and then tried to let the robosnail clean it it probably wouldn't do very well. But I mean seriously you can't really hold that against them considering if you go a week or two without cleaning your glass it's not like you're just going to rub the glass cleaner across it and be done. I mean you would have to scrub it down pretty well so you cant expect this little thing to do all that. But again if you clean it real good and then let this thing run every 12 hours it will maintain it. I did forget to mention that you also have to clean the top two inches and bottom two inches of the glass yourself. I don't understand why it can't clean a little further up. I have a canopy on top of my tank so it goes up until it hits the canopy in which it has a little mechanism at the top of it that lets it know it hit the canopy and sends it back down. But because of the way it's designed the scrubber on the inside won't get that top inch or two. But again as I stated I can live with that considering it's the first robosnail out there available. You do have to program it to keep it off the bottom so that it doesn't get sand inside of it. So therefore again you'll have to clean the bottom but for those of us that have big tanks especially the long ones I don't mind making a pass at the top and bottom once a week. It's not that big of a concern. Personally I think it's pretty neat but of course it's got its flaws. My biggest problem was the price. I think that it's way overpriced. Normally I don't really complain about the price because especially in this hobby I know everything's expensive but in this case I think it is still a little too pricey for something that lacks a certain amount of sophistication and design. That said I still purchased it and I'm sure many others will but if the company that made these don't do something about the design and price as soon as possible they're going to lose a lot of potential business because already they have these things in development that work off of Wi-Fi, have cameras included, and even allow you to map out the directions you want it to travel when cleaning your tank and at half the cost. From what I can tell this is the first company to make them available and nobody else has it coming out for at least about a year. Anyway I know I'm all over the board on this because I'm kind of in a hurry but thought I would type up a review being my first one wasn't exactly fair. I can't say that I would actually recommend it because unless you have a bigger tank this unit is too large and stands out a little too much and for the price of it that's kind of steep. I will note that the company did email me and say that if it fell off the glass they would replace it free of charge. I'm not the type of person to take advantage of people so I don't know that I would ever send it back even if it did drop and break but that was nice of them.  I guess it comes down to whether or not you're willing to spend the money. As I stated nothing is in this hobby is cheap so if you're worried about the money then it's probably better you not purchase it. But it is nice to have especially if you have a tank that 6 ft long. Overall its not a bad at all but ultimately due to the price I couldn't really go any higher than 4 stars."

It was easy to use, and THERE WAS A SCOOP, but I had to dig it out from all the way at the bottom of the container. I like to mix smaller size balls and feed more of them, rather than using less but larger balls to feel the frog that seems interested.\n\nI was curious to see if any other of my animals would be interested in this. I have dozens of different species of animals, and a few others actually seemed to enjoy this as well. I gave some to my Bufo americanus toad, and she was delighted. Also, all of my Fire Bellied Toads were interested in this, and all of them would ""fight"" over it. I do know that Crested Geckos should primarily be fed CGD, but about once or twice a month (more with younger ones so they put on weight), I will feed them some roaches. They go crazy over the roaches, so I thought they may try this. All of my crested geckos went nuts over this. I mixed it a little bit thinner by adding about 1:1 water and mix, so that it has roughly the same consistency of ketchup (or for those of you who have crested geckos, you know how to mix CGD up well).\n\nOverall,  this is hit or miss on if your Pac Man will eat it. I tried it with other animals, and it seemed to work well with a few different species. I would not solely rely on this, and it is a good idea to provide all of your animals the most diverse food you can use, as different foods have different nutritional values, and their needs are met when feeding different foods. Best of luck! Please reply or comment below and I will get back to you."

We applied this across the bottom section of the screen door, including the aluminum frame. The product went on nicely. It's firm enough that it doesn't fly all over the place (like car window tint material), and was not so sticky that you couldn't adjust it to fit just right. We applied one swath across the bottom of the screen inside, and a second on the outside, allowing them to stick to each other through the screen itself.

Last time I was at the vet's office he suggested I put her on very expensive calming dog food since her anxiety will eventually cause further health issues.  I have 2 other dogs, and separating food isn't practical, so I decided to try natural supplements.  I have to say that after trying 3 or 4 different things, THIS is the one that worked best for us.  She doesn't seem drugged or out of it, and she has completely stopped shaking.  She still nervous barks sometimes, but I can tell that this has helped her tremendously.  She is a different dog now - in a good way!  She weighs 12 pounds, and the directions say one pump per day for every 25 pounds, but I give her 2 pumps a day - one in each meal.

He is 13 pounds and easily carries these around. He also enjoys kicking these downstairs, fetching them back upstairs and repeating the game. I like the jumbo better as they are less likely to get stuck under furniture. Also, these are easier for me to kick when I join in furry family soccer games. All kitties like this size better for stomping, back leg kicking and the stalking pounce. My smaller cats do like the smaller balls for self play soccer games. Oddly, My elderly deep sleeping dog is often covered in these in the morning. I suspect  Meiko crushes on her and finds being ignored very alluring......HELPFUL TIP to keep these in play....I wrap black duct tape on inner aspect of legs of furniture and appliances.

We live on a farm and have no idea what she rolled in but the oppressive stink... it was like a sumo wrestler had died, became a zombie, and then took a dump onto a burning tire.  Fortunately we got this neem and tea tree shampoo in the mail yesterday.  Talk about putting a product to the test!  Normally we wash her 2 or 3 times (she is an inside dog) but it was getting late so she only got one wash and a rinse.  My wife is a professional groomer and knows how important it is to wash and rinse a dog many times to get a stink out but that was not an option this time.  This shampoo rose to the challenge!  The uber stink is completely gone from our dog.  She also looks fantastic and being an elderly dog it's great to see her fur looking so healthy.  Take a look at the picture.  I found a coupon code on the internet that gave me a modest discount on the price and the website asked (but did not require) that I leave a product review whether it was good or bad.  I'm putting that out there for full disclosure but this shampoo REALLY did eliminate the horrid stench of putrefaction our dog elected to roll in."

We've been searching for a new dog food for a while and had a chance to try several Natural Balance options. What we found in summary was that the food was well made, had mostly good ingredients, but weren't loved by my dog.\n\nHere's the breakdown: As my dog gets older I really pay attention to fat content. This one has a high fat content, which I didn't like:\n\nCrude Protein 21.0% minimum\nCrude Fat 10.0% minimum\nCrude Fiber 4.5% maximum\nMoisture 10.0% maximum\n\nI do like the high protein, though. You'd think with the higher fat content you would have a slightly more moist and tasty food but that wasn't my experience. The food is super dry, hard and about the size of a nickel each round piece. My beagle would only eat it when I added something to it (hide a treat broken into pieces in it, etc).

Landscape professionals told us that a physical fence was not a great option since removal of trees would be required, precipitating erosion in our small, steeply sloped yard. We were concerned that an in-ground fence would make our seemingly neurotic little dog even more so. Although we have no plans to leave our dog unsupervised within the fence; we needed was something that would allow us to enjoy our dog's company outside while keeping him and others (squirrels, cats, other dogs, children) safe and happy. He has a very high prey instinct and lunges fiercely at passing bicycles and motorbikes. This fence has far exceeded our expectations. So happy we made the purchase! We buried wire in front and side yards, but used yard staples on the sloped back yard, which is mostly wooded. It took a couple of days to do this on just 1/3 acre, but we were also dealing with weather issues. We were totally dependent on the flashing light for wire placement, as neither of us could hear the audible (to dogs) tone. But we managed to get it right. We've taken it slow and easy with the training, but have determined that our dog only pretends to not understand when we want him to behave. Only a couple of corrections and he already acknowledges his limits with the fence! He easily recognizes the difference between his leave-the-yard-for-a-walk harness/leash and the electronic collar, although he sometimes hides under the bed when he sees it will be the collar :) Lots of play time outside makes up for his occasional reluctance. Now, to get those flags picked up!"

Also, be careful of getting from this vendor because these are definitely not 2.3 ounces as advertised and in fact seems fake. I used my digital kitchen weighing scale to weight the individual with package and it still was less than 2.3 ounces. I am really upset because I have got same brand from a website for pet products in past which was awesome and a single piece lasted for 3 months but this one just didn't live up to the expectation.

So if you want a possibly toxic dye leaking into your dog's fur and skin, go ahead and buy this coat. I double-dog dare you.\n\nI tried the coat out and then let it drip dry in my bathroom. Now, I HAD noticed when I wet the coat and wrung it out (per the instructions) that there was some blue dye from the coat in the sink, but I just thought it was one-time/new coat thing. The coat was too big for my dog (in spite of measuring per their instructions), so I just left it to try over the shower bar. Later, I went back in to find blue dye ALL\nOVER my tub. This was...bad. It just kept dripping off the coat for hours. Literally, hours. I contacted the company. More on that below...\n\nAlso, the sizing chart is misleading. My dog is 70lbs, so this size coat is recommended. But his measurements fit 2 DIFFERENT smaller coats. But the site says ""If unsure, go larger."" So I did. Well, this coat was WAY, WAY too big for him, and there was just no way to tighten it enough.\n\nAnd that's the 3rd issue. It could've been made to fit with another 8-12 inches of velcro.\n\nThe coat stayed cool for more than FIVE hours...and it is VERY lightweight, but you'd have to be OK with putting a toxic substance on (and into) your dog.\n\nI e-mailed the company about the above issues. They wrote:\n""From the sizes you gave me I would say your dog is a size 18 or 20 as he fits into the girth and neck category for both.""\n- except their 20 size says it's for a 45lb dog and mine is 70lbs. Which says to me that their sizing chart should be breed specific.\nRegarding the dye, they wrote:\n""Our Ultimate Cooling Coat is safe to use as directed, however we do not recommend your dog chewing or ingesting the coat.""\n- Which sounds to me like an admission that it is toxic."

The T5s make everything in the tank beautiful, especially the fish. and the Marinelands make algae pop and take attention, but T5s make algae muted.\n\nMy other tank with a fluorescent fixture was in another room so I didn't have side-by-side comparison. but I moved it back into the room with the reef tank, and the results are mind-blowing.\n\nBuild quality and design, I give it a thumbs up! No problems with this whatsoever, and especially like the adjustable mounts.\n\nThe bottom line: this fixture is weak and dim, and the color spectrum is mediocre.

If your dog can easily fit on that size, then this should work just fine.  One of our two dogs loves to lay outside in the sun and I worry about her over-heating.  It took a few tries to coax her to lay on the cooling bed but she finally got used to it.

He steals the warm spot when someone gets up from sitting down, and you can regularly find him  sunk down into the middle of the fluffiest blanket he can find.\n\nWhen I first set out this bed, the other two dogs (our labs) jumped in and out, and our female dog rolled around and posed for a few photos in it. Then when she got up, our largest dog (male lab) got in and sat in it for a while like a king on a throne. But after everyone was done playing, it was the old mixed breed family dog, Buddy, who curled up to try and sleep in it. He loves the pillowy design, and it's just the right size for him.\n\nThe outside material of the bed is made of a thick washable canvas type of fabric, that can hold up to big rough dogs like our hunting labs. Sharp claws, chewing on bones in the bed, and muddy paws are all things this bed can handle. But even though the material is made with is a thick strong fabric, it's been well stuffed with plush stuffing to make it very pillowy for laying in.\n\nI'd say the medium size bed works up to about a 70lb dog, or so. But it will depend a lot on your dog's shape/height. Our largest lab is male dog about 80 lbs, and taller than the other 2 dogs we have. And while he does fit inside the bed, the size large would have been a little better fit for his shape.\n\nBut our much shorter and stockier female lab who's about 65-70 lbs fits inside this medium sized bed perfectly.  And our mixed breed dog is much slimmer, so much more light weight, but still about the same height (he looks like a smaller version of a German Sheppard), fits inside this bed perfectly too. If you have large hunting labs, golden retrievers or anything bigger, I'd say size up to the large. Average size labs can fit into a size medium.\n\nIf your dog is the kind that likes laying on thick plush blankets, then a pillowy bed like this will probably appeal to them. If they are dogs who over heat easily and tend to sleep on things like rugs, you may want to look instead at a more flatter style dog bed. We have both. Our largest lab likes the flat kinds of beds, and our mixed breed adores big pillowy bed like this Stainmaster bed."

After we had two dogs die of cancer in the space of 6 months, I aimed for those same standards for our remaining young dog. She had problems tolerating the only available all organic raw food so this generally meant cooking for her, and cooking nutritionally correct and calorie controlled meals is particularly time consuming.  I now alternate between cooking and using Honest Kitchen base mixes with raw or cooked meats and fish.  I take away a star because I think the recommended hydration time is insufficient.  My holistic vet feels good about Preference (Hale and Kindly weren't available at the time) , but I had steered away from Honest Kitchen because my dog often had digestive problems after eating them.  My vet must have heard that complaint from others, because she recommends a full 24 hour rehydration.  What has worked for our dog is to rehydrate the night before (under refrigeration) for feeding the following morning and evening.  In a pinch I use too-warm water to speed the hydration process and feed after only an hour.  With rehydration modifications digestive problems aren't an issue, and I appreciate the convenience and  freedom to add our chosen  sources of protein.  If their products were fully organic, I'd use Honest Kitchen all the time."

It's great for beginning recall work and giving your dog a bit more freedom on their walk. I have used it for hiking when my pup wasn't quite ready to be allowed off-leas, giving him space to explore and extra time to navigate the boulders, but keeping him safe from straying off the path to find rattlesnakes and the likes. Because it it longer than 6ft, however, it does give your dog a chance to build up some extra momentum so you should certainly use this attached to a harness, not a collar.\n\nUnlike a retractable leash, this one won't cut your fingers off, and it won't chase your dog if you do drop it, nor will it pop your eye out if the heavy-duty clip somehow came off of your dog's harness. It won't slice someone's legs if your dog runs around them (although it might leave a rope burn). It also won't teach your dog to pull like a retractable leash because they don't need to pull to get more leash. It just takes a little bit of practice to handle a long line, but it's well worth it!"

I honestly had never purchased a tunze pump before, so I did not know what to expect.. I needed another pump, as I had been using jebao, and I am tired of fighting and dealing with them.. I said I would go to tunze, because it integrates into my apex, their reputation, and they are cheaper than vortechs with Wxm.. But I wanted to test the waters with a smaller pump, before I plunk down almost 500.00 for pumps for my main display..\n\nSo far, this little guy has shocked me.. It puts out a lot more flow that I expected(it actually looks like more than my put out) and it's silent.. I took a star off, because as another poster indicated, when it first starts, you can hear it click, trying to find its center (I guess), but as long as that is all it does, that's is fine with me.. I don't turn it off (or plan to) often.. I was debating the 6040,but I decided to go cheaper as this is an experiment.. I forgot to mention that it is in a 40 gallon Rubbermaid tub that I am using as added water volume, and a sort of saltwater Lagoon.. I mostly have liverock in it, and will hopefully add mangroves soon..\n\nI will update if anything happens, however, I am really hoping for the best with this pump..

They had absolutely no concern that I would be without a skimmer and would not overnight the part.

I took off one star, however, because my cat just can't seem to deal with wearing this harness. He goes into corpse mode as soon as it's on him, keeling over and refusing to move, even when I try to tempt him with treats.

I can tell you it's not fun to clean diarrhea out of dog fur with baby wipes because your dog can't have a bath and the suitical was on, it takes a good 30 minutes or more to get it all out.

"562243","5","","B00O4AQ4ZM","95ed9b3f323406ce874f168f1c557adeKKYB","This is a board game for dogs and it has provided my dog with a definite challenge. Befitting such a product, the aesthetics are extremely utilitarian. Any decoration would be purely aimed at a dog's human owners. The plain wooden board features a track in which the ""game pieces"" are inserted. You need to put a small treat (I suggest something very dry, just to keep the board and pieces as clean as possible and avoid staining) in these little cups first. At the end of the track, there is a widening point where the cup can be removed. So you start the cups wherever you want - for a dog playing the game for the first time (or even the first few times), it's a good idea to play the treat-containing cups near the end of the track.\n\nOur dog became easily frustrated when she realized the treats she could easily smell (the hole in the top of each cup makes this possible - apparently a newly designed addition to the game since there are photos on the package with cups that have a solid top) were not readily accessible. It takes her some time every time she plays to figure out that these cups need to be nudged and pawed all the way to the very end before she can push them out of the track. Even after numerous times, she has not really caught on - so every time the game is played it is a 'new' challenge for her to work through.\n\nThe thing I like about the playing cups themselves is that they are made of a pressboard type of material - not solid wood. Your dog will be able to bite on these pieces without actually resulting in splinters or anything along those lines. Yes, the dog will leave teeth marks on the cups (which can be buffed away by some light sanding, in needed - haven't needed to do this myself yet) but the cups are pliable and relatively soft. This is not impossibly difficult, by any means, but it has kept our dog busy for a reasonable amount of time!"
"562259","5","","B00O4GCAZ4","4ece23278d78301c92ad010c5fef015824X2","This was a puppy shower gift. The owner loved the quality and look of these little pants. Her puppy is still too young to travel from the breeder to her new home, but my friend is excited to use these pants for house training at first. Then she will use them for their original intent."
"562356","4","","B00O8SZTKQ","c078f7aab5695a11f05dff91e549037cJW0V","I bought this for my 6 year old who has been begging me for a fish tank but I didn't want some huge eyesore that doesn't fit the decor in our house.  This tank seemed like the perfect thing and indeed it is visually stunning!  Is it the perfect tank?  No.  It definitely has some flaws as others have pointed out, but it works very well for our purposes, the fish, snail and shrimp love it and it looks very sleek, modern and sophisticated!  A few things to know before you buy this tank:\n\n1) Aquascaping a portrait aquarium like this can be very tricky.  It's hard to use the space well when it's a lot taller than it is wide and long.  You'll have to get creative.  Most likely you'll end up with a lot of unused swim space at the top and in the middle, but that's ok too.  Just know that you'd not going to be able to fill it with much stuff unless you get really creative.  Also, depending on how much stuff you put in it and how full it is, it can be quite tricky to clean as well.  That's definitely a drawback to this size and shape.  Because of it's size, you're going to need to clean it and do a water change at least once a week or algae and detritus could easily get out of control.\n\n2) If you want to grow any live plants that require medium to high light, you're going to want to upgrade the light that comes with the tank.  I did just that and bought the Hygger LED Aquarium Lights, Clip on Fish Tank Lighting Led Lamp for Fish Tank, Blue & White (30 Leds, 13 watt).  It works perfectly for this tank!  My monte carlo, Christmas moss and anubias are alive and happy.\n\n3)  Unless you keep your house pretty warm, you're probably going to need to buy an additional heater to go with this tank.  Keep in mind that unless you get a really small one, it's going to take up more swim space in the tank and take away from the sleek look.  I bought the Hydor 25W Submersible Glass Aquarium Heater - Original Theo thermostat heater and it fits in the rear compartment next to the filter pump so it remains out of sight.  You should know that the instructions tell you NOT to put a heater back there!  What can I say, I'm a rebel and a risk taker.  ;)  I don't keep the temp too high and so far it has worked just find for me.\n\n4)  Don't get grand ideas of keeping lots of fish in here.  It's great for a Betta, or Betta, snail and a couple shrimp like we have but that's about the most you should keep.  Maybe a Betta and a couple guppies OR a handful of neon tetras OR a pea puffer fish OR make it a shrimp tank.  It really can't host much more than that.\n\n5)  I won't go into the design flaws that others have mentioned, but they're real.  The flow is too strong for a betta on high.  On low, and pointed at the wall, my betta handles it just fine and seems very happy.  The rear compartment is a super nice feature to keep all the ""mechanics"" hidden, but it's poorly designed and could be way better.  Same with the rear compartment cover and the design of the lid (I keep it on backwards as others have mentioned).\n\n6)  I actually bought mine on Petco.com because it was $55 (which at the time was significantly cheaper than on Amazon believe it or not) so check around before you buy.\n\nAll in all we really love this tank!  It's perfect for small spaces and to add a bit of natural modern flare to a desk or a room.  If you have a Betta or want to get one, this would make a great home!  I can definitely recommend (with some upgrades) especially for the price!"

The male in particular can be injured if you don't know what you're doing. It's also easy to slide the tubing into the female's bladder instead of uterus.

You may throw the ball either very far, bounce it hard in front of you, or very high up in the air until you get the hang of how to throw using a straight stick.\nOtherwise my other ball thrower has been put in the car for use on trips etc, and this one is now my daily use stick.

This spray is all natural and has conditioners that help make her coat have a healthy shine. It is vitamin enriched and non-toxic. It can be used with topical flea treatment, which is nice, cause you can have treatment and not the odors. It is safe enough to be used on dogs, ferrets, and rabbits. I absolutely love the way it smells and is the perfect scent for the holiday time or any time you want to have your pet smelling great.\n\nOne thing I liked was that this was wrapped in plastic so it didn't spill while being shipped.

The customer service representative offered me a refund of the product's full price, without return, and an Amazon card as a courtesy. We both agree on one VERY IMPORTANT issue. Amazon posts can be very difficult to interpret. In my opinion postings should NOT require ""interpretation"" at all. For example: If you'll note the picture of this product is Green, but the print to the right says Natural Beige. There's already a Natural Beige mat posted so why would they add it again, this time with a Green picture? Amazon does this with A LOT of their postings. (I just saw multiple mispostings with Crane humidifiers.) You literally have to read between the lines when ordering a product. The customer service representative agrees that her company (and I think many other companies) should read Amazon's postings after providing Amazon with information. She said Iconik, the parent company, will check all of their postings in the future. (I'd like to add: If you go to the Iconik website they have amazingly gorgeous and unique bathroom rugs/mats). To end this: For Amazon purchases, ""Read between the lines"". For Iconik (casa pura) FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE! That's why I raised the star number."

The ones that you expect to last don't and the ones you get on the cheap sometimes last much longer than expected. With two Elkhounds I go through a lot of toys and chews during the year to say the least.\n\nWhen I first saw this toy I had hopes it would last awhile. Only the main body has stuffing and a squeaker. This toy lasted about an hour before the first limp was gnawed off. No worries there, the dogs hadn't officially killed it yet. So it stayed in the bin. Two days later I found another wayward limb.\n\nFast forward one week and yet another limb and some beard fur were promptly removed, but ironically enough it still squeaked so it stayed in the bin. Now two weeks after receiving it, all limbs have been removed, it has no beard fur and only one antler and looks like it has been through a major battle. But... and here's the big but... it still squeaks. The dogs still like it.\n\nSo, at the end of the day this is a toy that you need to supervise fairly closely so they don't eat the limbs or other parts, but so far even with 2 50 lb dogs it has stood up pretty well.\n\nI would have liked to see the limbs more than just knotted fabric and it's a little on the spendy size in my opinion in comparison to other dog toys of similar veins. Overall though a decent toy and it's cute enough too. Not that the dogs really care about that."

My guess is that it will fit her for another couple of months but not into adulthood.  This same company makes non-petite sizes but I don't think they are available on Amazon. This is the most comfortable harness, really easy to get in and out of (which matters a lot because it is much easier to maintain a positive association with the harness) and it sits high up on her shoulders/upper back - very secure but also ride down into her back and tummy the way most harnesses do, therefore it doesn't trigger the 'throw myself on the floor and refuse to move' reaction that is easy to see in cats.

The first one, its small size. This is smaller than other dog leashes I owned. Because of that, I keep this one always in my vehicle. Also, keep in mind this is 10 ft long, so again, for road trips it is perfect, because you know how it goes when you stop by a resting area and dogs go kind of crazy. You better have them near you, so 10 ft is great. The other thing I love about it is that you can personalize it and make it yours by changing its interchangeable cover.

I tend to favor martingale collars, that tighten up a bit as they're pulled on (to reduce the chance that a dog can slip out if it backs up while on the leash), but that's partly a reflection of the type of dogs I've had and the fact that their head size makes them a bit of an escape risk. This is well padded and good looking. I'll add, though, that I hook to a harness instead of a collar for walks, so we haven't done any heavy testing of how well those latches stand up to being pulled. They seem like they should be fine, I just haven't tried it myself under real walking conditions."
"579985","4","","B013GGU0QS","5c0277cf13323215f4b16010d21156d9QH23","A few years ago my oldest dog started having seizures, I made it a priority to give him the best, he gets home cooked meals (seizures stopped), he has a memory foam bed, I got him a no pull harness, and I swapped out his stiff collar for a padded ergonomic collar, the smaller version of this collar. The collar seemed to make a huge impact, I hadn't thought about it before, but they wear them every day, all day, if the collar is uncomfortable they just make do, I wouldn't want to make do.\n\nWe also Foster dogs in our home and these dogs are typically ill mannered, or abused, neglected, never been in homes, etcetera. Our most recent Foster was a big gal, Great Pyrenees Husky mix. She had never worn a collar. And everytime I put her one she would flop about like I was ruining her life. So I tried this collar on her. She wasn't instantly comfortable, but she didn't freak out. And when the collar stayed on for several days, we took that as progress. She also turned out to be one of my favorite walking companions, right next to me, slack leash, confident and well behaved. When she was ready to go to her forever home her family showed up with a very attractive but rather stiff collar. We did the swap, she flipped around on the floor like she was being tortured. So, they put the ergonomic collar back on her and will be getting there own soon.\n\nI give this four stars because in her initially flailing about she managed to open the collar a few times, but once she calmed down it stayed put. It is definitely easier for quick on and off."

It's looks and feels like the standard thick nylon collar on the outside, then lined on the inside with a spongy and squishy fabric. It's an incredible idea and feels like it must be so much more comfortable for dogs to wear than standard collars.\n\nThe adjustable part is hard plastic, but the thick collar keeps the hard sections of the collar away from the dog's neck. It adjusts with a sliding piece that reminds me of what was used in adjustable skates in the past. Also there's a thick steel ring attached to the top of the collar that's strong enough to hold even large dogs like my labs.\n\nIt looks good and is designed for comfort. One of the best dog collars I've ever seen!"

The Ferplast may change my mind, but the real question is how it will stand up over time.\n\nThe Ferplast is an attractive (silly, cute dog symbol on the handle) leash that has a single button for a locking mechanism.  So far, this works out well.  It's easy to lock/unlock and the tape is of good length.  Most of the retractable leashes in the past I've used, tend to lock up when they shouldn't or get sticky locking/unlocking the mechanism.  This, so far (and to be fair, it has only been a few walks) has not had that issue.

The fabric is a soft cotton that is comfortable for all day wear.  I purchased these for use on my miniature dachshund that weighs approximately 10 pounds and the fit is just right for her.  The diaper has two leg holes and an additional hole to place the tail in.  I found these easy to get on once my dog stayed still long enough for me to pull them up on her.  They have a string to tie around the waist that allows for you to tighten the diaper to fit comfortably around your dog's waist.  This is just what I have been looking for to use when my female dog is menstruating to keep my floors and soon to be new furniture protected from stains.  I use a thin disposable pantyliner inside the diaper to cut back on cleanup and for sanitary reasons.  I simply change the pantyliner each morning/evening and wash the diaper as needed.  The diaper is extremely cute on as well and looks like a stylish pair of briefs that are sure to get some smiles and giggles from others.  I actually tired these on my male dog prior to use for my female and he looked so cute walking around in these.  My female dog didn't mind having these on and kept them on while my male dog didn't seem to enjoy them as much and tried everything he could to get them off.  I highly recommend these for protection against unwanted stains throughout the home and even while on the go.  I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

They do seem a bit on the big side even though I measured my dog prior to order so I wish I had gone with a smaller size as she can get them off if she is persistent enough. I like the design and the material they are surprisingly well made for the fact that the cost is not that bad at all. I will be ordering another set probably soon that is a size down. I do work with rescues sometimes and am also always donating to them so that is very helpful so if these are too large I can find someone that needs them especially in puppy mill rescue. They have washed well and they truly are a nice pair of pup panties. I would recommend them to a friend with the caution they seem a bit loose.

I plan to also use it as a travel day bag for dog food when I'm out for the day. I don't even need to carry a purse when I'm out for a walk as it holds everything I need to for the day. The material is really sturdy and waterproof. The bag holds it's shape and doesn't sag even when I load it up inside and out. I have another pocket type treat pouch that goes around my waist; it is flat with a pocket only the outside. However, it tends to squish the softer treats and can be harder to reach into. The price for the Meedory Dog Treat Pouch is really great for such good quality.  I definitely prefer this pouch over the others I have tried. Having it on allows me to train my puppy no matter where I am.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meedory-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Premium-Quality-Dog-Training-Bag-Hands-Free-Design-Allows-you-to-Teach-in-Comfort/dp/B0165IU73A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meedory Dog Treat Pouch - Premium Quality Dog Training Bag - Hands Free Design Allows you to Teach in Comfort</a>"

Also the stairs and other pieces were difficult to snap  Definitely very challenging if you have any arthritis/carpal tunnel in the hands or fingers (which I do).

He has to go there when we eat because if not he is in your lap begging for food or when we have guests over because he likes to step on toes and climb into laps. He's a doberman so that isn't really a cute thing. Before anyone asks yes I have tried every method possible to get him to stop doing this. He has just always been a whiner since the day he came home. That was almost his name. So I started this thing at the lowest setting and it seemed to work for about a week. It supposedly has a detection system that makes it so he has to bark/whine multiple times before it gives him a little shock. After the first week it stopped working. I checked it with the little tool they give you to see if it's working and it lit up so it's supposedly still working it just wouldn't shock him. I turned it up to the highest sensitivity and it still didn't do anything. Basically don't buy this. I'm not sure how it works but it will only work for me and the tool if you blow in a little hole. I have no idea how that is supposed to be triggered by a bark or whine. So don't waste your money like I did. Buy a training collar like I ended up doing, or go to tractor supply and get one that works."

She has begun shedding like a madman and the brushes I have already just don't work on her. I've tried everything from a tick comb (doesn't pick the hair up), shedding brush (doesn't work on her short hair), furminator (just flings the hair off) and a bristle brush (not enough hair gets picked up by it). I really was hoping to find something at the local stores that was like an old grooming mitt I had in my horse grooming supplies. Unfortunately, that handy brown mitt seems to have been discontinued.\nI found this and didn't have high hopes but figured it was worth a shot. Plus I'm drowning in hair here. I don't know where it's all coming from, there is no way she has this much on her! I just got it today and tried it on. I gave her a rub with it and OMG the amount of hair that came off her was amazing! It looked like it was snowing (she's white). It even ended up making tufts that would tumble off the mitt. It got off so much hair!!!\nWarning though... do this outside! It took off so much hair but it brushes it off loosely so instead of a packed ball of hair from a furminator, it sheds off all over the place.\nThe glove itself works on both right and left hands. On either of it's seams there is a small slit to put your thumb through. This is what makes it able to be worn both ways.\nI honestly, truly can't talk highly enough about this product.

I think the important part is that it doesn't really have a scent to it, so it doesn't make them think they are eating something different.\n\nI think it is just like joint supplements for humans.

He's 13 and has started showing less and less interest in his dry food. He seems to prefer waiting for the treats they get when coming in from outside and making that his main source of food. While the treats are good quality ones, being made of jerky from various types of meat (some beef, some chicken, some duck, etc), I've been trying to find a regular dog food he has interest in eating. This turned out to be that food.\n\nI initially picked this up to use as a topper to go with my dog's kibble. Because of the size of my dogs (both well over 80 lbs) it would cost a small fortune to feed them both this as a regular daily kibble replacement. But after trying this food out with them, it reminded me that my larger, older lab was eating such small amounts (compared to how he use to eat) this was actually a good fit for him. I put this with his kibble and it gets him nibbling on it and not just holding out for his jerky treats. So I'm feeding this to just him.\n\nMy other lab likes it too, but she has an incredibly sensitive digestive system (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) and 95% of foods and treats give her tummy troubles. She loves to eat them, but they don't love her back. She does best on a very specific type of food (made from lamb) and a very bland dog treat made from oatmeal and pumpkin. She did get to try this out and does like it, but it won't be replacing her other kibble that keeps her digestive system in check."

The red one is intended as a nightlight while the blue is for ""anytime,"" which is a little strange. They run on button cell batteries (which are included) and you can set them to blink once every few minutes or have a constant glow. The lights are designed not to harm your typical pet but seem added purely for a child to enjoy some kind of lighting effect, as if the hamsters were on a stage on Las Vegas and you wanted to show them off this way.\n\nMy main critique is that the advantages of the light are for the owner, not the pet. If I were a hamster I would have trouble sleeping if I were subjected to lights night and day. If you have a child who's afraid of the dark, then this lit-up cage would good in his/her bedroom, as it offers a sight of her beloved pet in the dark. Otherwise, it seems a little silly and extraneous.\n\nLike other cages it comes with a water bottle, wheel, and food dish.

I am very familiar with nose and pad balms as they have been a tool that I use all year but especially during the winter months.  Salt, ice, snow, and cold temperatures can make a dog's feet become dry on the insides of the pads and outsides.  Dogs noses can become dry all seasons but frequently in the winter.  I have been using the Nose and Paw balm by kin+kind for almost a month now and am impressed by this hand-mixed formula.  Pad and nose balm needs to be a bit waxy so that it stays with the pup during activity.  It seems that it has soothed the pets I have worked with. The ingredients are simple but great and it feels like a good formulation.  The only thing so far that I am noticing is that it is a little grainy at times until warmed up but not overly so like some I have experienced.  2.3 oz is a lot because it is ultra compressed.  Try and use a little on your knuckles and hands and you will see the difference it makes with one application on yourself. I think this formula will help a lot of dogs and I would re-order."

I also have a purple portable table and purple clippers, and purple towels so this comb was perfect for me.\n\nLuckily, at house call grooms I only groom small dogs because as some reviews state, this is a small comb.  It was plenty large enough for the poodles, shih tzus  and small terriers  that I see on a regular basis.  I would not recommend this comb for people trying to groom their larger breed dogs.  This comb is also not great for trying to pull undercoat from thick coats. It is just to small and hard to hold.

So I know leashes.  Boy, do I know leashes.  I am forever buying them.  Not only do I buy them for my dogs but for the ones who are going to their forever homes.  I like to send them off in style.  When I had the opportunity to test this leash and write an honest review in exchange for a discount, I thought sure.  I buy so many leashes that I know quality and a good value when I see it.  This leash is 4 long and about 3/4 wide. So many leashes are only 3/8 wide which is half the width of this one.  It is my experience that 3/8 is too narrow for a medium or larger dog.  While this leash it light weight it is quality and well made.  I am happy with the purchase.  If I do send it off with one of my foster dogs, I shall definitely look to buy another of these.  I purchased the red color. It is not a cherry red.  It is more a wine red.  If you are comparison shopping for leashes, remember length isn't the only thing to look for.  Check out the quality of the clasp, the stitching on the handle and the clasp, and the width of the leash."

Granted we only let him use it in carpeted areas. It's well designed to exercise their brain, which helps them become happier and calmer. This was recommended by our trainer to prevent our boy from getting overanxious and attacking our senior dog out of frustration. Do not ever let them play with it unsupervised, if it does break, they can end up eating the plastic along with the treats inside."
