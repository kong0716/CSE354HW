From the overexposure of the ""tweens"" sound of Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus, to lack of great rhythms by others, people just haven't found anything really strong. But for U.K. singer V.V. Brown, she is really finding her footing well in R&B and Soul. She did that noblely with Shark In The Water, her first single from her debut single from Travelling By The Light, now her latest single, L.O.V.E. tries to bring out the 60's Pop & Soul rhythms of the mainstream, that acts like Dusty Springfield brought out back then. While it was delivered a few years ago by Duffy, V.V. Brown is following nicely. Hopefully, she can keep it up, and be brought out more from her songs.\n\nSong: B-"

(I even bought it off iTunes like I never do just because it had an extra track for the same money.)\nI hope they come to St. Louis. (Or maybe they have already--I don't get out much...) I don't think there's a weak track--even the extra one.  The whole album is short and sounds a bit like a soundtrack to a French Spaghetti Western set at Syracuse University in 1986(Syracuse University...You got nothing to say...)  I love it!!"

It combines the lo-fi punk approach with a distinct pop sensibility and a gorgeous girll group type vocalizing. While teh lo-fi recording is obviously done on prupose and would hurt many other recordings here it serves its purpose prefectly well by enhancing the underlying pop sensibility. The combined effect of 60's girl group hooks and noisy approach is actually what the Raveonettes tried without any success to attain on their recordings. The Dum Dum Girls actually succeed mainly because they have more talent, actually  belong  to a real scene where this kind of music does naturally occur and they are less poseurs than that other group. This group obviously has their hearts in the right places since they are on Sub Pop records as well."

But for her singing, she definitely doesn't seem to show anything other than being with the Tween crowd. That is honestly the case with her latest song Kissin U. I really didn't find the song to be anything over the top, but it at the very least is a change of pace from other acts whom have been a bit overdone like the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus.

That can be a touchy subject, but Thorn's thorny mournings go down easy, couched as they are in comfortable melodies.  ""Oh, the Divorces!"" is a speculation on who's next; ""Singles Bar"" explores the same question in a very different context.  The punchy ""Hormones"" wryly laments the generational differences in biological clocks.  The highlight is ""Late in the Afternoon,"" a beautiful, bittersweet, multi-layered observation on the seasons of love.  This is not an album for the millennials, unless they're interested in what makes Mum's clock tick."
"153","4","","B003JL70WS","e4e2871279b2906510d7411f4121e70aDHGC","There's no getting around it. Most of those who will be curious about this album miss the full-fledged Ben& Tracey team of Everything But The Girl. But EBTG certainly had a lot of different flavors to it. My favorite period was their last, the electronic/house period -- the final three albums. Much of their earlier work was more intimate, spare, maybe more personal in a way.\n\nMost of the material on Tracey's Love and Its Opposite probably compare to that early work. It's softer, less beat-oriented. There is a dance song here, as I recall. And Kentish Town -- not a dance piece by any means -- still has a hypnotic rhythm. It's probably my favorite song on the album. A bit dark, mysterious, ethereal.\n\nSo, if you like the spare and acoustic EBTG, you'll probably enjoy this album more than I did. I'm not a good judge of lyrics, so I won't comment on them, except to say they didn't sound bad or clunky. I focused on the music. Though it was pretty, I can't say the songs really grabbed me. I did enjoy Kentish Town and Swimming most of all. Perhaps I'm not in the situation in my life to appreciate the topical subject matter.\n\nI hope some day we can see another group effort. Until then, this album should satisfy at least part of the EBTG fan base."

And I think they want to be known as musicians any way.  My favorite songs are Skyline, The Coast, and I Miss You.  But the whole cd is pleasant enough."

While she has been very close a few times with her music, not anything definitive. Also with the recent heartbreak she has undergone from her suicide attempt, many people have wondered if she has been able to re-deliver. Her latest single, Bittersweet from her album Back To Me isn't really all of that. While the song isn't bad, and so far is one her better songs, it just hasn't been definitive to what Fantasia has really to blossom to. I do hope that Fantasia can really wow everyone for her next single, but from what I've heard from Back To Me I really cannot say.\n\nSong: C+"

For all this album is, in the same light, it floats off into the clouds, is vague, and entirely too sweet for my liking.  What can I say, I need some edges on which to hang my hat ... so it wasn't until the song ""Papercut"" drifted from my speakers, that I had a sense that Tift Merritt actually had something to say, and in a manner that held my attention.  Believe me, it's fine for songs to be etherial, but they need to be memorable, otherwise this is just an album to slip off to on a Sunday morning when you're trying to shield your eyes from the sun as it creeps in through the blinds.\n\nOthers have compared Tift to Sheryl Crow, though she dances on the indy side of the scales.  I once heard Tift in an interview saying that she never really says what she means ... and folks I tell you, it shows.  Sure, this is a very intimate album, at least it was designed to be, it has a really nice opening track ""Mixtape,"" but for the most part See You On The Moon doesn't go anywhere, nor does it allow your imagination to take you anywhere, other then setting the stage for a reflective somber morning about life in general.  In another interview Tift said that she has always subscribed to the less is more attitude ... and that shows as well ... excluding the tracks ""Mixtape,"" and ""Papercut,"" where she subscribes to the more is better philosophy, and has something to say in an exciting manner, lifting the vail of obscurity, and revealing the two finest songs of her career.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler"

I have always been a fan of Chrissie's, from the very beginning of the Pretenders first release back around 1979. I have every CD, Concert DVD, Video DVD, & Box Set released by all the various versions of the Pretenders. I even have a DVD of Chrissie & the Pretenders being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, near Chrissie's hometown of Akron, Ohio.\n\nI'm happy for Chrissie, that she has finally found her perfect lover, ""LUCKY JP"". I love Chrissie, but I'm a little jealous of that JP guy. Just like some of the other reviewers, I've always had a crush on Chrissie, but I also love her music and videos. This Deluxe Edition is one great package for a Chrissie Lover. The songs tell a tale about the love story between her and JP, and the struggles they had to overcome. It's a beautiful, real life issue, love story that ends with commitment & fidelity. The Deluxe Edition contains 2 bonus songs: ""Christmas Soon"" and ""Skinny Love"". The Bonus DVD contains videos for ""If You Let Me"", and ""The making of If You Let Me"".\n\nThis is a real treat, for any Pretenders &/or Chrissie Hynde fan. Thanks!!!!!"

Young ""Stevie"" Winwood as he was known back then was just 18 years old when the Spencer Davis Group burst onto the scene in early 1967. Within just a few months the group boasted a pair of Top Ten singles. Yes, the future appeared extremely bright for this four man band from Birmingham, England. But Stevie Winwood had other ideas. Before the end of the year he would leave the Spencer Davis Group to form his own band that he dubbed Traffic. Winwood's timing was impeccable because Top 40 radio was just beginning to wane and within just a few years album-oriented rock stations would come to dominate the FM band. Over the next decade Traffic would become a staple of these AOR radio stations. In 1969 Winwood also became a part of rock's very first supergroup Blind Faith. Then in 1980 Steve Winwood would embark on a highly successful solo career.\n\nDuring the decade of the 1980's Steve Winwood would amass more than a dozen charted singles including 6 Top Ten hits.  Of these the most  acclaimed was hit 1986 # 1 hit ""Higher Love"".  With background vocals from Chaka Kahn ""Higher Love"" would spend a total of 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  The song would snag a couple of Grammys including ""Record of the Year"" and ""Pop Male Vocal"" of the year.  One of the best singles of the 1980's."

It came out a couple of months before I finally had enough money from my first job after college to buy a 35mm SLR Minolta camera in 1973.  I only wished later that I had waited one more month so I could have gotten the next model up with the hot shoe for the flash (say wha? What's a hot shoe, man?).  What a beat this song has! What a hook this song has! Mama did not take Paul's Kodachrome away (the absolute best and truest color rendering slide film there ever was even though it was the most expensive and slowest ASA speed).  Kodak itself took it away after the digital camera appeared on the scene. Sigh. I upgraded the Minolta camera to another film camera in the mid 80s. I still do not like digital cameras. Have you ever used one between 9 am and 4 pm in the desert on a day with NO clouds? Or outside anywhere during a bright day when there are NO clouds? The LCD viewing screen cannot handle that sun! The LCD screen one the camera I have now is difficult to see in sunlight. The screen on my cellphone is difficult to see in sunlight. Give me back my viewer if you can't give me back my Kodachrome!"

(Blowin' Money Fast)"" took off. It was a mixtape joint that just blew up out of nowhere. That was like the summer anthem. Then you got Styles P on it. His verse was cut short for some reason. A lot of people felt like SP messed the song up. I disagree, his verse served it purpose.  And then you got two high energy song like ""MC Hammer ""and ""I'm Not a Star"". Yall know those songs will get hype whenever they come one. Yeah, Yeah he recycled the formula but thhe make it work!\n\n""Freemason"" is another song I like on here. Ross basically trolled everybody with title Lol. Keep in mind this is everybody was running with the Jay Z Illuminati stuff. Me personally, I stay the away from all of that type off stuff. Back to the review, Ross did his thing, but Jay bodied this joint! His wordplay was crazy ""He without sin shall cast the first stone/ So yall look in the mirror, Double-check your appearance/ B****, I said I was amazing/ Not that Im a Mason/ Its amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in/ Lord forgive me, I never wouldve made it without sin"".\n\n""Aston Martin Music"" is just one of those smooth radio joints. The song was so dope that Drake and Chrisette Michele had to make their versions of it! ""Tears of Joy"" is dope too. Cee-Lo did his thing on the hook. Its funny to hear Ross address the DJ Vlad situation."" A punch in the face get you 300K/ ask Vlad, Now he back to making minimum wage/ another victim of my criminal ways"". S***, the punch basically made Vladtv what it is today Lol. I bet Vlad don't regret getting punched one bit Lol. Also check out ""Super High featuring Ne-Yo"" and All The Money In The World featuring Raphael Saadiq, which is one of Ross' most personal joints.\n\nNow lets into the bad. ""No. 1"" is wack! Everything about that song is wack. The lyrics are wack, the beat is wack and the hook is extremely wack. Am I the only one not feeling ""Live Fast, Die Young"" and ""Maybach Music III""? There weren't necessarily wack, but its something about those two songs that I cant really get into. I really cant put my finger but oh well...Overall I really enjoy this album and I think its safe to say that Teflon don is the most accessible Rick Ross album. I like how short the album is with just 11 tracks. Ross solidified himself in the game and this album took his popularity to a whole new level. I definitely recommend checking this album out."

I enjoy every song, even ""Rococo"" (strange lyrics but awesome music). Win Butler has a great voice, it's full of emotion and melody. How can you not feel something on tracks like: ""Modern Man"", ""We Used to Wait, ""Deep Blue,"", ""Ready to Start"", and the title track? The answer is, you can't. He has this special, rare quality to his music that you can't fake or manufacture. Beautiful album by a beautiful band. ""The Suburbs"" is a meaningful and unforgettable album. I listen to it all the time. And I don't care what people say, I also like their latest album, ""Everything Now"". I appreciate that the band are not afraid to change up their sound with each studio album. So with that being said, I recommend ALL 5 of their studio albums, but start with ""The Suburbs"" - it's their most groundbreaking. Enjoy!"

"558","5","","B003XB5TRC","1ca7c9c175035a01cd9bac0243ff2a7bM2W2","If you listened to all of the hype back in the day this guy was supposed to be an emerging superstar. Bob Lind was a folk-rock singer-songwriter from Baltimore. After dropping out of college Bob moved to Denver and began working the local folk clubs. Shortly thereafter he made a demo tape. The folks at Liberty records were duly impressed and signed Lind to their World Pacific subsidiary. Among the tunes on that demo was ""Elusive Butterfly"" which became his first and only hit single peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1966. Much was expected of the follow-up record ""Truly Julie's Blues"" but it proved to be a major disappointment. The well must have run dry because for all intents and purposes Bob Lind was never heard from again. Still, ""Elusive Butterfly"" is a beautiful song that is well worth remembering."

In 1968 Capirol records released a single called ""I Love You"" that had originally been recorded by The Zombies and released in August 1965 as the B-side of the single ""Whenever You're Ready"". That record went absolutely nowhere in the U.S. and the tune had been largely forgotten until early 1968 when People decided to record a cover version. ""I Love You"" did quite well in the USA peaking at #14 and selling more than a million copies worldwide. It was also a hit in Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Once you know that the tune was originally a Zombies song it seems so obvious. I just don't know why I never made the connection. It fun to hear this again after all these years."

"708","5","","B000VRLBH8","95b04be1287661f846ed5b874793454fVHIM","Much in the same league as Miles Davis,Prince,Paul McCartney,Ramsey Lewis and other unpredictible musical talents who scare the same astrological sign Brian McKnight is also a soul artist. That means that by the very essense of the music he has two sides to his creative personality. In his case,one side wants to say...appease a female companion or purely be himself. Usually the former element wins out,both musically and lyrically. So the title of albums is very appropriate as duality IS the theme of this album. Both of duality of himself as a musician and that of his general personality as well. In the end they both often work hand and hand. Brian McKngight has always had just a little too soft a touch on the romantic end of things,taking only that element generally from his influences and not their sense of irony and multi faceted outlook on the topic. Not only that he chose one of the most appropriate influences to draw on with this final release for him on the Motown label.\n\n  One of the major clishes of the last couple of decades in the R&B world is what I refer to as ""the next Marvin Gaye"" syndrome. Often enough this departed talent is used as a measuring stick by which almost all emotionally naked modern neo/retro soul influenced music is measured. In this case,as if it wasn't present in a huge way already McKnight takes the Gaye influence to the next level. More in the groove with a heavier bottom than the previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-Turn/dp/B00008H2L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U Turn</a>. In fact on the defiant hearted ""Grown Man Business"" and ""She"" they grooves and melodies are downright hard-the bass line brooding and pumping in particular on the latter for two of the funkiest numbers McKnight ever laid down. Even more midtempo shuffles such as ""What We Do Here"" and ""Stay"" feature a similar type of flavor. Some songs such as ""Everytime You Go Away"" and ""Here With You"" explore McKnights already well explored weaker emotional side,again ready to cave into denying his true emotions to fawn over and weakly beg to his lover.\n\n  Now it's on the final four songs that the Marvin Gaye influence comes on the strongest. Strong funky soul grooves ""Come Back"" and ""Watcha' Gonna Do"" as well as the breezy,spare jazz style of ""Your Song"" all come purely out of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-Going-On/dp/B00007FOMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's Going On</a>&nbsp;school of cinematic Motown soul/funk. The last tune ""Me & You"" takes on the flavor,both musically and lyrically of the ""other"" famous Motown male solo star (we all know who that is) in looking at the analogy of Jesus's crusifiction along with McKnight's own racial identity struggle as a possible reason why he along with so many others in the black community in America turn to the Christian faith as a means of inner salvation. So many of these tracks have great grooves,great meaning and the concept hangs well together as an album. Being that the few weaker and stereotypical McKnight tunes fit so perfectl into this concept this is one Brian McKnight album that is actually very consistant. And because it showcases his abilities at their best it also qualifies as one of his strongest full lengh album releases."

From a heartbreaking suicide attempt, to rumors of cheating with a married man, she has had a rocky return to the mainstream. But nevertheless, she is trying hard with her voice and her songs. Her latest song, I'm Doin' Me the second single from her Back To Me album feels like it is a back to square one modern R&B rhythm she is trying to capture. The song isn't a bad song from Fantasia, yet it isn't as driven as her earlier songs had shown like Bittersweet and Even Angels when it was released as a solo song back in January this year. While Back To Me as a whole wasn't her strongest suit, this is honestly one of the better songs to download from the album to your MP3 music library if you're a hard core Fantasia fan.\n\nSong: C+"

I admit that I was drawn in because of the guitars and the well timed singing of this song. However, I did not figure out the meaning of the song until after I lived here in the Washington D.C. area (through online sources). I actually understand why our military (and our allies)have to continue be supported both politically and financially as well as trained yet this song still catches my attention because some of the lyrics ended up being prophetic."

Sparing no expense to work with some of the top people in the music industry, Shambhu set out from California for the bucolic splendor of Vermont to record at the studio of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. To say that the supporting musicians are an all-star cast would be an understatement, and includes bassist Tony Levin, who plays with Peter Gabriel, Eugene Friesen of The Paul Winter Consort on cello, and a host of other top notch musicians who tour with the likes of Santana, Pat Metheny, Ravi Shankar, Yanni, and more.\n\nBut at the center of this luminous universe is acoustic guitarist and composer Shambhu. In his own words, ""My compositions reflect a diversity of musical influences from across the globe, from contemplative to Indian-jazz fusion to contemporary instrumental.""  All radiating a ""heartfelt feeling throughout."" This is simply some of the finest music of this type that I have ever heard. And I'm obviously not the only who thinks that, since the album was named ""One of the Best of the Year"" for contemporary music by Common Ground magazine and has received nominations for Best New Artist, Best Album of the Year, Best World Music CD, and Best Acoustic Instrumental CD. A track from this CD is featured on a recently released compilation entitled ""The Gathering,"" produced by Will Ackerman.\n\nOne of the outstanding features of this project is that it is actually a multi-media experience. Shambhu thoughtfully filmed the entire recording process, and in the beautiful accompanying booklet, entitled ""A Guide To The Journey,"" as well as on his website are links for the videos on YouTube, which I found absolutely fascinating. ""Sacred Love"" is a journey well worth taking."
"820","5","","B0042IQ7YO","889e6950d11de4656e04e9f09f9f9b5d20QH","It is the highest joy\nTo feel the taste of life\n\nShambhu's music is very expressive. It easily plunges you into an exciting world. In general, Shambhu's guitar solo is weightless and deeply meditative. It is free from pain and suffering. His music inspires you to open your heart and to hear the vibrations of love and compassion. It gives a rest for your soul and helps to achieve clearness for your mind.\n\n""Sacred Love"" is the debut album by Shambhu. It was produced by legendary Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. Many first class musicians have participated on the recording of this release. As a result ""Sacred Love"" is a multicolored carpet which imbues with the aromas of various cultures and musical traditions.\n\nThe debut album by Shambhu has the unique, mesmeric flavor of the music of India. And at the same time it is a really western born project. Cello, violin and other parts of traditional instruments bring tenderness and a classical charm to ""Sacred Love"".\n\nOne wants to listen to these fine tunes very attentively in order to not to miss each nuance. Shambhu's music is penetrated by many subtle details and when you listen to the composition ""Imagine"" you, without effort, are able to recognize the thoughtful and slightly ringing guitar of Will Ackerman. His touching soul manner of performing cannot be confused with anybody else.\n\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that ""Sacred Love"" has a perfect sound design. Its sounding is pure and exquisite. When I listened to the album of Shambhu one thought appeared in my mind again and again: how could I live without this wonderful music all the time before?\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]"
"821","5","","B0042IQ7YO","f6a5badcf55dcbefb928aacd23c07085B2XG","When you integrate one proficient acoustic guitarist with select vocalists and instrumentalists, along with the skillful production talents of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy Winner Will Ackerman, the final product might expectedly be a top rated album compiled by dedicated music professionals that virtually everyone would love and appreciate.\n\nShambhu is the proficient guitarist clearly asserting in his website news pages that his first album has truly been a "" labor of love "" while composing, performing and co-producing with Will Ackerman, along with his time spent working beside other top music professionals.  This I can believe since at the end of the day, Shambhu and his insightful selection of collaborating musicians has paid off rather handsomely, and by their collective time spent together, have helped convert this debut release into a commodity of premium value.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey is New Age Fusion, Contemporary Instrumental, and Jazz, having East, West, and World elements which help facilitate the conversion of artful melodies into solid gold entertainment that requires only simple involvement for the rest of us to acquire the appreciable benefits of this grand endeavor.  Sacred Love has already achieved a quantifiable amount of success, where at present Sacred Love - Feel The Journey is # 1 for the month of October 2010 in ZMR's Top 100 Chart, but I also have a feeling this album will appreciate in value even more over time.\n\nShambhu is an esteemed musician in his own right performing concerts or on albums with top music entertainers like Bob Hope, Carlos Santana, Jon Anderson and on Whitney Houston's multi-platinum album titled simply Whitney.  The list goes on since Shambhu has also been involved in projects with many of the respected musicians I continually write about like Will Ackerman, Jeff Oster, Eugene Friesen, Ann Licater plus many more.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey on the Acoustic Shine label has an impressive cast and crew since many have toured or recorded with top musical groups themselves.  Some of these artists on Shambhu's album include Tony Levin of Peter Gabriel on bass, Jeff Haynes of Pat Metheny on percussion, George Brooks of John McLaughlin on saxophone, Celso Alberti of Steve Winwood on drums, and then Premik Tubbs of Santana and John McLaughlin on flute.\n\nTogether is the first of 12 songs total and what a memorable impression it creates.  The center stage guitar and violin pairing established securely alongside flute and reflective instrumentation is magnificent, plus it is easy to visualize this song and others in a Cinematic role since the warm, sincere, and dynamic atmosphere echo the characteristic essentials for a multitude of made for the big screen movie settings.\n\nNatural Moment is a warm and casual song that positively takes off and ascends to new heights.  First expressed during the initial sequences, xylophone and numerous percussion enhancements become the lively components that merge into a free spirited narrative complete with smooth and graceful electric guitar rhythms which intensify and progress neatly into a picturesque arrangement.\n\nMaiu Breeze is refreshing by exhibiting a jazzy tropical presence.  First conveyed by acoustic guitar highlights, the integral xylophone rhythms and harmonious vocals filled with energy and vitality are a natural accompaniment to the guitar arrangement.  Together they merge perfectly to bring out the compositional fascination of this album and its entirety, creating a dynamic atmosphere that leaves one with an impression of total harmonic refinement.\n\nThis first release by Shambhu will always be termed a debut as one might expect, but when you consider his proficiency as a guitarist, the impressive number of outstanding talents on this extraordinary album, and their combined lifework totaling a significant number of decades as esteemed music professionals, then this masterful first album by Shambhu truly does amount to a rewarding and appreciable "" labor of love. ""\n\nFull musician credits are Eugene Friesen - cello, Charlie Bisharat - violin, Ravichandra Kulur - flute, Michael Manring - bass, Jill Haley - English horn, Claytoven Richardson - lead vocal, Jeff Oster - flugelhorn, Noah Wilding - vocals Todd Boston - sarod, mixed and engineered by Grammy Award winning Corin Nelsen."
"822","5","","B0042IQ7YO","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Sacred Love"" is a fascinating and inspiring collection of twelve pieces composed and performed by guitar virtuoso Shambhu and co-produced by Grammy Award-winning Windham Hill-founder Will Ackerman. Styles range from quiet meditations to Indian-jazz fusion, and some very impressive musicians join Shambhu on a wide variety of instruments. To quote Shambhu: ""my work has one goal: to convey a celestial abode in music and superb musicianship that invite listeners to explore, enjoy and reflect within.... 'Sacred Love' invites full-on, soulful listening."" While it's true that this music won't stay in the background, it can provide a colorful backdrop for other activities. The blending of Eastern and Western musical traditions gives Shambhu's music a very distinctive sound, and the incredible team of Ackerman and engineer Corin Nelsen makes the quality of that sound as close to perfection as it can get.\n\n""Sacred Love"" opens with ""Together,"" a joyful and optimistic piece that features Charlie Bisharat on violin, Premik Russell Tubbs on wind synth, and Tony Levin on bass - a great beginning! ""Edge of Eternal"" is quieter and more subdued, and features Imaginary Road regulars Jill Haley on English horn, Eugene Friesen on cello, and Noah Wilding on wordless vocals - lovely! ""Eyes of a Child"" is a gorgeous guitar solo that ""expresses the illumination of a child who still marvels at the beauty of simplicity and the simplicity of beauty."" My favorite track is ""Natural Moment,"" a lively and upbeat celebration of oneness and cultural diversity. Shambhu performs on guitars, sitar, synth pads, and kalimba backed by Tony Levin, Charlie Bisharat, Jeff Haynes (percussion), and Rocky Fretz (piano). If you can keep your body still while listening to this one, you really need to loosen up a bit! ""Revelation"" is another favorite. It begins as a graceful duet for guitar and cello, later adding English horn, bass, and light percussion. A slow, tranquil flow creates a musical daydream. ""Maui Breeze"" is as light and refreshing as its title. Claytoven Richardson (vocals) and Jeff Oster (flugelhorn) also appear on this track. ""Shiva Grove"" is an east/west jazz fusion with sax (George Brooks) and flute (Ravichandra Kulur) soaring over the chordal guitar foundation. ""Humility"" is the concluding bonus track, and is a duet for guitar and flute (Kulur). Also an east/west fusion, it conveys gratitude and humility before ""the Source of Creation"" and brings this exciting album to a close.  Recommended!"

Yet, it is so sad that it has been 35 years since John Lennon was tragically murdered, and the songs that he has recorded on his own, and with The Beatles have stood the test of time deeper than meets the eye. I honestly have loved the songs that he had recorded near the very end of his life, when he released his Double Fantasy album. The songs from that album have stood taller than almost everything he has recorded from the 70's. One of my favorites is Woman, because of its simplicity in saying I love you in just a simple ballad. t truthfully is one of those songs that really takes me into a time where I do wish that John Lennon was still making music, before he died. He wrote this song to share his heart with Yoko Ono, and it still is a lovely song after all this time. If you love John Lennon, than download this song.\n\nSong: B+"

That is totally right on. Such a beautiful song. It is a message of hope and peace, easier said than done, but worth aiming for. Only one world for all of us, let's share it and be good to each other. It shouldn't be so hard to live a simple, kind-hearted life and to be happy. Lovely piano chords, and that little turn to the E chord after 'you may say I'm a dreamer' is the magic moment, the golden hour."

Prior to releasing that hit, she released the lesser known, but exceptionally good song ""Starry Eyed"".  Unlike ""Lights"", ""Starry Eyed"" has a slower, more deliberate pace for a ballad about being caught in those moments where lovers are lost in each other's world together.  One of the nicer aspects of ""Starry Eyed"" is the accompanying music video, which has Ellie and her on-screen boyfriend stargazing and getting lost together at twilight.  For anyone who is a fan of ""Battlestar Galactica"", they could easily make you think of Apollo and Starbuck.  Ellie is going to be big.  I can't wait for her next work."

It provided a glimpse at what Ellie Goulding's potential.  This song sounds great on really good headphones or speakers with lots of bass.  Ellie Goulding is a self taught musician and her range is nicely displayed in this song.  She also uses lots of cool electronic effects in this song similar to Anything Can Happen.\n\nOn what this song is about:\n""It's about letting go. As opposed to all the sad and depressing things I write about, I decided to write something about the joining together of people in some kind of euphoric statebe it at a festival, at a show or in a club. I wanted a song that would reach out to people of every background and every enjoyment, whether you enjoy a natural high, taking drugs, drinking or whatever. Because I'm essentially a pop artist I wanted to write a song that everyone can relate to."""

It really wasn't really anything to rave about, to deliver from his Where I Wanna Be mastered days. Hopefully, he can deliver with more amazement for his fans to accept him all over again. That would be where he would want to be.\n\nSong: C"

I commented sceptically on the enthusiastic welcome given this disc by another fellow reviewer , the Santa Fe Listener, but am again ready to recant and say that five years later I am convinced that Grigolo is managing his vocal and career development very wisely. Perhaps the continued dearth of really Italianate tenors has made me more susceptible to his gifts but I am now genuinely enthused about his ability to carry the torch.\n\nThe best things about his voice apart from its intrinsic beauty are his evenness of production, the way in which he inflects the music with musically acute details and the clarity of his diction. He has studied and acquired all the little vocal refinements which allow a singer to inject the note with emotion without being too overt about it; hence he has mastered the judicious use of portamento,  the acciaccatura, the messa di voce and the despatch of fioratura - all of which may be heard to perfection in the best track here from the same role in which I have just heard him live, ""Una furtiva lagrima"".\n\nI was surprised that he opes this recital with an aria from a heavier, spinto tenor role but he manages it without strain and even returns to a second aria from ""Un ballo in maschera""sings in track11. He does not here yet have quite the full weight of voice to do it full justice but his attention to colouring the text is exemplary. The programme includes several weightier arias alongside some standard bel canto numbers;hence early and middle period Verdi features, as does some heftier Puccini, as an indication of the direction he has gradually been taking since. In fact, there are only two Donizetti arias here;the rest are all from those two other composers.\n\nWhile his voice does not have the distinctive ping of the young Pavarotti, he sounds far more pharyngeal and virile than Bocelli - and I like his chutzpah in throwing in a high C sharp at the end of the aria from ""Il corsaro"". I look forward to bigger and better - but all in good time as he is still three years off forty as I write.\n\n(PS: the three supporting comprimario voices who make brief appearances in two tracks are absolutely dire - why?)"

It might even be in my top 5 Cube records. The lyrics were so on point, between it and Laugh Now Cry Later, it really seemed like hed found that spark he had when writing stories back between 90-93.\n\nThe music and beaten on I Am The West is probably my favorite since Lethal Injection because it was modern AND extremely unique, not just piggybacking off whatever sound is popular the minut he was writing the song... because if you write a song to be popular right then, chances are, in 6 months when its released, its gonna sound played out, let alone a year or two from now when you're looking for something to listen to... bottom line, musically, this is top 5 of his to me.\n\nBut now the problem... the reason this album only gets 3 stars is because this is the FIRST album hes put out in his (at the time) 24 year career containing ALL but one song (Hood Robbin) is essentially just emceeing the whole time... in other words, just bragging about himself and his skills/rep. Gone are the stories and descriptions of life in that way that only he does.\n\nThe whole reason Cube has stood above the rest is because hes always balanced the emceeing with the storytelling (with a strong majority on each album leaning towards the latter) because Cube was supposed to be ABOVE that petty garbage and all the rappers that based their entire careers off doing just that.\n\nBOTTOM LINE, any Cube album is a great rap album because no one does it like him. The music is great, his lyrics are still great, its just the subject matter is weak, and unfortunately, subject matter makes up about 51% of the reason that an album great, and about 80% of the reason an album is worth listening to more than once."

"1042","4","","B0045F9WWS","be4edae88f523c6a2ae48376fde792280IA6","Dimitri Mitropoulos was a superb conductor who has been somewhat forgotten nowadays. He led the NYPO for several years from the late 40's to the late 50's, with the great Leonard Bernstein following him. Mitropoulos had a brilliant way of conducting modern music that wasn't heard too often back then, with a conducting style that was once compared to a ""Byzantine monk furiously shaking martinis"". One of the composers he excelled in was Gustav Mahler, back when Mahler was rarely heard. This is a live performance of the ""Tragic"" sixth symphony from April 10th, 1955. It is very, very, good, if a bit flawed in a few places. For one thing, the sound quality is surprisingly good for a live recording from the mid 50's. But, there is a patch of some kind of electrical hiss or whirl in the fourth movement. Maybe it's the download or it's the original recording, but it's very annoying. Fortunately, it only lasts about 2 or 3 minutes. The audience is not too intrusive with coughing and such.\n  As for the actual performance, it's fantastic. The work moves at a nice pace and sounds like the sixth should at almost all the right spots. The second and third movements are presented as andante followed by the scherzo. You know, one way you can always tell a true Mahler fan apart is to ask them the question ""Which do you prefer, scherzo before andante, or andante before scherzo?"" A true fan will know just what you mean, and then be emphatic on their opinion of the order of those movements. I have always preferred the Scherzo before the andante, perhaps because that's the way I first heard the symphony. You know what they say about first impressions. Plus, I feel IMHO that you need that long, beautiful andante to come before the nearly 30 minute finale. The metabolism, or ""Blood Pressure"" if you will, of the work needs to slow and calm down in order to prepare both you and itself for that finale. Could you imagine Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the molto vivace scherzo coming right before the Ode to Joy finale, and not the slow movenent? The same goes for Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 or Mahler's Fourth. Now I can't damn the performance or recording because of this. It's a personal preference, and of course andante before scherzo does work for a lot of Mahlerites.\n  In the end, this recording is for die-hard Mahler fans. Or die-hard Mitropoulos fans. If you want a good first recording of the sixth, try Pierre Boulez and the VPO on DG, which is the best version I've ever heard. George Szell also does great version with the Cleveland Orchestra, now out of print I think. As for Bernstein, the second version, on DG from the 80's is also a must have.--------------PEACE"
"1044","5","2","B0045F9WWS","4d9f27fd24d51c5baf75a02075e4b4adM7EL","Previous reviewers have already covered the obvious merits of this live performance and broadly agree except perhaps regarding the extent to which the NYPO plays accurately. I have to say that apart from a few minor burbles from the trumpet and horns which remain perfectly acceptable in a live, I am amazed by the unanimity of their drive and attack; Mitropoulos galvanises them into giving a truly ferocious account of the stretti passages in the first and final movements and they are very sharp in following both the conductor's beat and the frequent switches in rhythm and time signatures characteristic of Mahler's scores. It is clear that Bernstein by no means had it all to do in familiarising this orchestra with Mahler in the sixties; his mentor had obviously already rained and enthused them.\n\nThe only reason to regret the slightly raw and quite resonant mono sound is in the huge, tutti climaxes of the finale, when Mitropoulos generates an extraordinarily glorious cacaphony as the titanic struggle between optimism and despair unfolds; otherwise the acoustic, by accentuating the typically strident whistle of the violins when they are playing high up on the bridge, if anything, adds to the excitement. However, Mitropoulos knows when to let the music swoon and sigh and again prompts me to wonder just how influential he was in informing Bernstein's own style in Mahler.\n\nThere is some radio whistle a few minutes into that finale and the audience are a bit restive up top that point, too, but both irritations pass and Mitropoulos keeps the screws on to the bitter end - and indeed it is, deeply dark and forlorn.\n\nI have an entirely irrelevant and personal reason for favouring this recording; it happens to have been made on the same Easter Sunday over sixty years ago when I first saw the light of day..."
"1045","5","3","B0045F9WWS","36d1fea99a72a767f76417be06e08b8eAM12","My copy of this powerful live Mahler Sixth is a download, so I can only surmise that tis is the same Mitropoulos reading that appears in the deluxe box set of Mahler broadcasts released by the New York Phil. in 1999: there it is listed as Carnegie Hall. April 10th, 1955.  I share the lead reviewer's enthusiasm, especially because the only other Mitropoulos Sixth in my collection is wretchedly played by the Cologne WDR orchestra.  But I must disagree with the lead reviewer about the precision of this New York performance. The first trumpet barely squeezes out the exposed high note at the beginning (it must be treacherous, since in a live reading by Karajan and the Berliners the first trumpet actually misses the same note). Other mistakes, such as the occasional struggling horns in the finale,  are minor, to my ears at least, and overall the execution is miles ahead of what we heard from Cologne. Like Hermann Scherchen and Jascha Horenstein, Mitropoulos managed to be great and sloppy at the same time.\n\nthe lead reviewer considers the tempo for the andante to be unusually slow, but at 15:02, Mitropoulos's pacing is a minute slower than Bernstein and two minutes slower than Karajan, both on DG. Where he is certainly right, though, is in the spontaneity and intensity of this recording. At his best Mitropoulos was a passionate conductor with a sense of real aliveness, like is protege Bernstein. Yet there is a sense of poise, also, making Bernstein's two readings more impetuous overall. Mitropoulos takes the opening march in the first movement at an almost stately pace, closer to Barbirolli than to those who take Bernstein's cue and drive the beat home with crushing immediacy and threat. The Scherzo is quick and forceful; by contrast Tennstedt is far more harrowing in his recent live reading with the London Phil.  the tendency to underline Mahler's emotional extremes was much less present in Mitropoulos's day, and what seemed biting then is fairly normal now -- which isn't to take away from the spontaneity and excitement of his Scherzo.\n\nIn the finale Mitropoulos doesn't go for the nerve-racking intensity of Bernstein and (especially) Tennstedt, allowing quite a few moments of relaxed rhythm and measured pacing. But it's all in the service of a slow build that finds the right moment to crest in terrifying outcries. Some may feel that however great a performance, the Mahler sixth needs full spectrum stereo. Here we have excellent, well-balanced mono without microphone distortion or a radio producer riding the gain during climaxes (not that noticeably, at least).  I had no trouble finding the version at hand, from the Archipel label, not the one pictured here, quite listenable. I even wonder if this French off-label didn't pirate the NY Phil. source.\n\nAt this moment used copies of the complete Mahler broadcasts sell for $450, so being able to attain a decent-sounding version of tis famous Sixth is a boon. It fully justifies its reputation."

""Numb"" which is also considered the bands first official release is a blend of many styles from rap, hip hop, rock and even dance. If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is gonna hit you hard as it's a giant leap in quality.\n\nHash and Tac who are the two mcs/vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style, it helps that they both have distinct voices and don't sound like each other. The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track ""Numb"" before the vocals kick in, it's a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note, in reality it's just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles. ""Tell Us Why"" comes bouncing out with heavy beats and industrial sounding guitars as Tac and Hash are joined by Binary Audio who were two thirds of the British band Radiator, Janne Jarvis joins on vocals and the song has a real Nine Inch Nails style to it. ""Turn Me On"" has a great interplay of vocals and keeps the album flowing into ""My Song"" which features former memeber Cant on vocals, the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy. The track features a cool loop throughout the track.\n\n""The things You Think I Say"" features Approaching Nirvana on vocals and he gives the song a Linkin Park laid back sound. ""The Pursuit"" sounds like vintage ""Licensed To Ill"" Beastie Boys. ""Take This Away"" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background, it's a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well. On ""I Can Be Real"" ABiCA get real heavy, with some big drums and heavy guitars, the song is produced by Tweaker Ray who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself, his production qualities really shine on the track.\n\nABiCA even give us a big dance sounding track on ""Gave Em A Reason"" a track that features a big chorus. Former member Cant appears again on ""Blurry"". The final track ""What You See"" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties, it's a great way to finish off the album. The only complaint you can really level at the album is that at 16 songs it might be too long, especially for a debut and considering the short attention span climate we now live in.\n\nWith ""Numb"" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album, which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012. It's amazing to think the Tac and Hash have produced and released their own album, the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release, the artwork is cool with detailed information on who produced and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was. ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself ""Dos Dedos Mis Amigos"" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals. ABiCA are determined to get their name out there, and even on Hash's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people. ABiCA ""Numb"" deserves to be heard by a wide audience!!"

It took a few listens for me to truly grasp this band, but in the end I found Numb to be a very competent effort from a band that quite plainly has a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThe music teeters between full-on hip-hop/rap to alternative rap/rock reminiscent of Limp Bizkit and old Linkin Park. Layers of synths swirl alongside heavy guitars and drums to create an energetic soundscape that completely carries this album. The production on the record is top-notch, and some of the best instrumentation I've heard in this genre. Furthermore, the album has just the right amount of variety to keep it interesting. At sixteen tracks, you may think it'll be a bit on the long side, but the songs sound different enough that you will never feel the length. Standout tracks include ""Tell Us Why"", ""The Things You Think I Say"", ""Take This Away"", ""Gave Em A Reason"", ""Never That Far Away"" and ""What You See"". I must especially single out ""Gave Em A Reason"" as probably the best track on this album. It's a high-energy thrasher that keeps going till the very end. On a side-note, from hearing the record I would imagine Abica's live shows to be some of the most energetic and intense around!\n\nUnfortunately, the album does stumble in a few places. Lyrically, it's hit or miss. Not that the lyrics are bad, far from it, but they sometimes feel a bit overly simplistic. It's striking since it's such a stark contrast from the meticulously-crafted music behind them. A prime example of this is ""Beautiful"", which despite the brilliant backdrop ends up being a rather generic hook-up song. Another head-scratcher is ""Blurry"", which is an awkward reconstruction of the song ""24"" by Jem (with no mention of original songwriters Jem Griffiths and Justin Griffiths in the linear notes). It's not a remake, the music, beat and chorus share the same melody with ""24"" but the lyrics are original. I personally felt the song lacks the punch of Jem's version and ends up the weakest point on the record. Also, and this isn't really criticism, around two times on the album there is some very melodic singing during the song's bridge. I would really like to hear more of that! Not that the rapping and raspy vocals are bad, but the singing just added a little uplift that gave those songs a little more depth.\n\nBut ultimately, Numb's numerous strengths far outweigh its few drawbacks. Abica has created a strong and robust album that's sure to please fans and invite new ones. I really enjoy this album, and I definitely look forward to future releases. I'm anxious to see how this band grows and evolves in the years to come."

The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.\n\nIf forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.\n\nMusically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less ""processed"" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing.

The song I heard referenced this song so I decided that I wanted to hear it. I love the lyrics and the blend but I was made aware of who exactly it was that I was listening to and  I lost interest quickly. There was no good beat to go with this song so the best thing about it was the lyrics. However, I am stumped as to what he means when he talks about two styrofoam cup. Is he talking about cough syrup? I am lost. Is this a new thing or what?"

I remember the song when it first came out because it was being promoted for the newer version of the Charlie's Angels Movie (Charlie's angels is even quoted in the song). I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as ""the shoes on my feet, I bought it"", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in). This is also a good song to listen to for putting oneself in a prosperous state of mind.  Overall, this is definitely a song to listen to if you like any of Beyonce's songs and/or any music from Destiny's Child."

In fact, between 1974 and 1986 Don would amass an impressive total of 17 #1 hits on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart.  Despite all of his success as a country artist Don Williams could never seem to come up with the crossover hit that most country artists were always looking for.  Then in 1980 he recorded a ballad written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin.  Don finally had his crossover hit.  ""I Believe In You"" spent an impressive 20 weeks on Billboard's Hit 100 pop charts peaking at #24 in November of that year.  Meanwhile, ""I Believe In You"" would also become Don's eleventh #1 country hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.  Good stuff!"

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it.

It's simple, but its synth beats and ""yodeling"" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!"

Unlike her other songs about sex and butts, this really gets to your heart chords and it's like you're in your own pink fairy tale.

Some of the songs I hadn't heard before (not surprising since they were hits in the UK, not the US), but many I had. Yes, I sing along with this vocal candy ( a guilty pleasure is I'm Henry VIII, I Am). It puts a bounce in my walk and is perfect to do clean by -- all that energy seems to make chores easier.\n\nIf you enjoy 1960's pop music, you should definitely include this group in your collection."
"1660","5","4","B004CT4I2Q","cd0ea9603bbca64d5397c02e607833f4EEHP","Sure, Peter Noone was a safe teenybopper idol and the Hermits weren't frequently used in the studio, but what a great string of lightweight pop singles they left behind in the wake of the second wave of the British Invasion. In 1965 alone they had six Top 10 singles (including two No. 1's) and sold millions of records, rivaling The Beatles for chart dominance.\n\nGranted, this music isn't quantum physics, but songs like ""I'm Into Something Good,"" ""Silhouettes"" and ""Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" were infectious ear candy for those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties. One of the first six albums I bought (I now have over 7,000) was INTRODUCING HERMAN'S HERMITS with the three previously mentioned singles on it. It also contained a lot of covers like ""Sea Cruise"" and ""I Understand,"" but this was a singles band which is what makes this such a terrific collection. The only singles missing are their last two to chart in the U.S.--""Don't Go Out Into the Rain (You're Going To Melt)"" and ""Museum,"" both from 1967.\n\nInstead we're given a handful of failed US singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although several of them hit the top ten in the UK.  Since this is, after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of package. [Note: No. 1 songs like ""Mrs. Brown"" and ""I'm Henry VIII, I Am"" are on this set, too, even though they were never released in the UK as singles. So this collection seems to be a compromise for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.]\n\nHere is the complete track listing:\n\n1. I'm Into Something Good (US #13, UK #1)\n2. Show Me Girl (UK #19)\n3. Silhouettes (US #5, UK #3)\n4. Can't You Hear My Hearbeat ((US #2)\n5. Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (US #1)\n6. Wonderful World (US #4, UK #7)\n7. I'm Henry VIII, I Am (US #1)\n8. Listen People (US #3)\n9. Dandy (US #5)\n10. Just a Little Bit Better (US #7, UK #15)\n11. A Must To Avoid (US #8, UK #6)\n12. You Won't Be Leaving (UK #20)\n13. This Door Swings Both Ways (US #12, UK #18)\n14. No Milk Today (US #35, UK #7)\n15. East West (US #27, UK #33)\n16. There's a Kind of Hush (US # 4, UK #7) [Note: Their final US top 10, 1967]\n17. I Can Take or Leave Your Loving (US #22, UK #11) [Note: Their final US top 40, 1968]\n18. Sleepy Joe (US #61, UK #12)\n19. Sunshine Girl (UK #8)\n20. Something's Happening (UK #6)\n21. My Sentimental Friend (UK #2)\n22. Here Comes the Star (UK #33)\n23. Years May Come, Years May Go (UK #7)\n24. Bet Yer Life I Do (UK #22)\n25. Lady Barbara (UK #13) [Note: Their final UK single, 1970]\n\nThe skimpy four-page booklet provides a brief history of the band, only one photo (the cover shot--minus Karl Greene), and a track listing that includes the songwriter and year of release. The CD label says ""stereo,"" but there is no mention of remastering.\n\nLast summer, I saw Peter Noone and a touring version of the Hermits (no original members) at a free concert. It was great fun to listen to him sing the old hits, and this generous 25-track compilation provides a nastolgic trip down memory lane. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [Running time - 65:38]"

"1718","5","","B004DD1U40","4e05fd5639f7f06b382b24d4ab3f237dR5D5","I remember hearing More Than A Feeling on a Saturday morning in the Fall of 1976, in our station wagon as my Mom drove me to gymnastics class. I liked the song so much that it caused me to make my first and worst mail order record purchase. The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.\n\nI finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?\n\nLater on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream."

Kesha is very similar to her peer Lady Gaga, the two of whom debuted at the same time; the music is pretty much the same so if you love Lady Gaga you'll definitely love Kesha. The difference between her and Lady Gaga is that Kesha's style is harder, she's the ultimate party girl, and she on a mission here to party non-stop. The songs are primarily dance tracks, with slightly harsh electronic (I think its electroclash not to sure on the sub-genre), but surprising it suits her voice, Dr. Luke and his cohorts did a wonderfully job with production despite the harsh electronic background that surrounds her, Kesha doesn't get lost in the mix and its her that stand in the forefront. Most of the tracks (the really goods ones) revolve around drinking, party, and boys. But please don't think for a minute that she is just another puppet most of it is written or co-written by her and she can actually sing. (Something she better demonstrates on Deconstructed). My favorites from ""Animal"" are Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Tik Tok, Kiss N Tell, Your Love is My Drug, and Take it Off. From ""Cannibal"" are Grow a Pear, Sleazy, and Crazy Beautiful Life"

On top of that, over the years he has been a part of 4 or so group albums and a large handful of mixtapes.  Flash back just about 20 year ago when Redman broke into the rap scene and started a name for himself, a name and persona that would build over the years and eventually lead him to well-known and respected veteran status in the rap game, and breaking that fame into the TV and movie world.  This hear, being his 7th album, compared to his others, I'd have to say it's toward the bottom; but don't get any ideas that it means the album isn't quality.  Compared to his other releases, he's done better work, but this album still is worthy of a strong 4 star rating.  Here is my ratings of his other solo albums:\n\n""Whut: Thee Album"" (1992) --- 4 stars\n""Dare iz a Darkside"" (11/94) - 4.5 stars\n""Muddy Waters"" (12/96) --- 4.5 stars\n""Doc's Da Name"" (12/98) --- 4.5/4 stars\n""Malpractice"" (5/01) ---  4.5/4 stars\n""Red Gone Wild"" --- (3/07) --- 4/4.5 stars\n\nOn top of those I have 4 group albums he's been a Part of (Def Squad's ""El Nino"" from 6/98, and 3 albums with Method Man: ""Blackout!"" 1 & 2 and the ""How High Soundtrack""), plus he has put out a decent amount of quality mixtapes over the years as well. This one has 13 songs; 1 is a Classic, 1 or maybe 2 that I'd skip over, the other 10-11 are good or real good songs.  Guests are on 6 of the 13 tracks, and are mostly his normal guests from the old crew; 4 songs they are rapping on and the other 2 they provide the chorus.  Production is on point for the majority of the album, (like he always provides our ears) but has a couple average or sub-par songs on here. 13 different producers each do 1 song: DJ Khalil, Ty Fyffe & Efrain Rodriguez Jr., Tone Mason, J. Rub, Rich Kidd, Rockwilder, The Futuristiks, Fyre Dept., Freak, M. Phazes, Three Sixty, The Audibles, King David, all do a song each.  The man continues to show he has talent still in the tank after almost 20 years blessing our ears and drops another album worth checking out.\n\n#1 - 9 (nice beat & has him spitting for 32 bars straight)\n#2 - 8\n#3 - 6\n#4 - 8 (f/ Ready Roc, Runt Dawg, Saukrates -- has one of those annoying auto-tune choruses)\n#5 - 5 (worst song on the album)\n#6 - 8.5 (f/ Faith Evans)\n#7 - 9 (f/ Saukrates, another one of the overused auto-tune choruses -- nice beat)\n#8 - 9 (another nice beat)\n#9 - 9 (f/ Ready Roc & Melanie Rutherford -- good beat)\n#10 - 10 (CLASSIC over a Great beat)\n#11 - 8.5 (f/ Method Man & Bun B -- nice beat that sounds like one of the many great, old Nintendo beats)\n#12 - 8.5 (f/ Poo Bear -- good beat)\n#13 - 9 (Another nice beat)\n\nReggie Noble -- b. 4/17/70 -- Newark, NJ\nCheck all my reviews"

"1857","5","","B004FXCPV0","1ca7c9c175035a01cd9bac0243ff2a7bM2W2","The popular American actress and singer Debbie Reynolds broke into show business at the tender age of 19 back in 1950 with her portrayal of singer Helen Kane in the feature film ""Three Little Words"".  Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.  Just a few months later Debbie would score a Top Ten hit with her first single ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"".  And after her memorable performance in the 1952 musical comedy ""Singin"" In The Rain"" with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor the name Debbie Reynolds would be forever etched in the folklore of Hollywood.  Given her vocal prowess many people expected Debbie Reynolds to become a fixture on the Billboard pop charts.  You might be surprised to learn that this simply was not the case.\n\nIt would be another five years and 14 films before Debbie Reynolds would have another hit record.  It does not appear that a recording career was a top priority for her.  In 1957 she co-starred with Leslie Nielson and Walter Brennan in the romantic comedy ""Tammy And The Bachelor"".  The song ""Tammy"" made its debut in that film and was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Original Song.  The tune was a massive hit with the record-buying public as well.  ""Tammy"" would remain on the Billboard Hot 100 for an unheard of 31 weeks and spend 5 big weeks at the top of the charts.  Over the next couple of years Debbie Reynolds would have a couple of more hits but nothing could compare with the popularity of ""Tammy"".  i suppose that in this day and age most people would consider a song like ""Tammy"" to be pure unadulterated schmaltz.  But in my opinion, there is something to be said for such schmaltz.  Even as a teenager in the 1960's I loved this song.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio."

Its as if you are alone in a cathedral listening to him just making all of it up on the spot. Truly it sounds that fresh and immersive.\nAs an aside its noteworthy that these X5 Music Group compilations usually have one portion that is of incredible value.

That is what has happened with the tragic death of George Michael, whom died on December 25th, 2016 at the somber young age of 53 years old. He was a absolute gift in the soul of the heart with his work. He had crafted some of the most beautiful ballads of the past 35 years of music. When he was with Wham!, he had brilliant pop songs that were guilty pleasures, and when he was starting to be on his own, he made the deepest statement from any breakthrough as a singer with Faith. One of my favorite songs from Faith that had been more underrated, but deep at the heart, is Kissing A Fool. He really began to take a deeper heart when he stepped away from Wham!. It just is a delightful gem that really hits you when you really hear the song from the beginning. While everyone had been more focused on I Want Your Sex & One More Try, I was focused here from the start. If you have never heard a song of George's, this one would be a loving memory to start with.\n\nGeorge Michael: 1053-2016\n\nSong: B+"

Not only because they are true blue-eyed soul, but they still are better than what is on radio today. His songs have still the impact today, as they did back in the 80's and 90's. But the one that started the ball rolling for George on his own, I Want Your Sex, the lead single from his breakthrough solo record Faith doesn't feel as controversial as people made it back in the 80's. I liked how George was able to prove himself, away from his Wham image, and it still captures a rawness that still is vibrant as today as was the case back in the 80's. If you have never heard a George Michael song, this is one of the first I recommend.\n\nSong: B 1/2+"

In 1963, after several unsuccessful attempts in the music and show business, they finally linked up with famed record producer Phil Spector. By then, the group called themselves 'The Ronettes,' named after lead singer Veronica Bennett (Ronnie) who eventually married Phil Spector, then becoming known as Ronnie Spector. This song, which is performed impeccably, turned out to be a huge hit for the Ronettes. It actually influenced artists such as Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame and Cher. Many other hits followed. 'Be My Baby' was one of my personal top favorites for the year 1963. The vocal and instrumental arrangements are outstanding. I just love this song. It is a true timeless classic."

This was the reality Bobby Darin was forced to cope with. Even in his early teens Bobby Darin knew just what he wanted to do with his life. He craved the spotlight and realized early on that music was in his blood. Not only did he love to sing and perform before live audiences but he was also an extremely gifted songwriter and a talented musician as well. And because of his serious medical condition he was determined to make a name for himself before the age of 25. Well lo and behold Bobby Darin did just that!! In the decade between 1958 and 1968 he churned out more than 40 singles. Several were major hits including his signature tune ""Mack The Knife"". Perhaps my favorite Darin recording is his big 1960 hit ""Beyond The Sea"". This was the stuff of night clubs and Broadway shows. Audiences loved it and the record zoomed to #6 on the national charts. Don't hear this much on the radio anymore but when I do I crank up the sound!"

For me the title tune stands out. Even after all the decades it still fires an emotional response and does not get old.\n\nThe song itself an old folk song which is anti-prohibition and as performed by Traffic is a little sorrowful sounding to me. Almost as if sung in mourning. In the end we know that prohibition ended as the song predicts with ""and little Sir John with his nut brown bowl proved the strongest man at last""\n\nBack in the days when this came out I was in a local band playing guitar. Traffic was one of those influential sources that inspired us and became part of the soundtrack of that portion of my life.\n\nJohn Barleycorn Must Die is a classic song with an iconic performance that has stood up well for at least 47 years so far. Such was the magic of Traffic in their prime. Without question 5 stars from Traffic"

It graced the end of Halloween, the classic horror film and has been in any number of movies depicting the fifties era. I dare say it makes you feel like it's the fifties. The Chordettes are important in rock history as one of the first ""Girl Groups"" as they were called, to break into the charts at a time when sexism was standard practice and other phenomenal groups (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison to name a few) were king. Many female vocalists existed but these harmonies belonged to the Chordettes and gave them a place. Mr. Sandman happens to be the creme de la creme of their work in my opinion."

"2368","1","","B004RSH036","0835f52d333afb346182a0e65c1afbd8SSJ9","Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.\n\nIn June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him ""being guilty of a serious criminal offence"". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.\n\nIt is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.\n\nThis individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.\n\nMore mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.\n\nThe track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime."

It's definitely not nearly as crushed as the Ten Remix. And there is a bit more detail and bass compared to the old master done in the 90s. The bonus tracks are decent as well. Overall, this is a solid reissue in a nice, large digipack. Go was a nice change of pace from the sound of Ten and really is the first record where they actually sound like the band they are today. It's not their best overall, but it has more than a few solid classics. Recommended."

Both the fan base and Damon Albarn would agree that this is the groups weakest album musically. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that this is Gorillaz most ambitious album to date, just for the simple fact that the album's creation was limited at the time of its release. This album was completely composed by Apple iPad music apps. The amount of depth and creativity Damon was able to produce and record off of a simple iPad is truly astounding to me, because despite the album not breaking any new ground sonically, the music on this project is still of high quality. I personally can enjoy this album on its own merit. But when compared to the previous 3 Gorillaz project, it falls short. Because of Damon's choice of using only music apps, the albums sound is not as rich or organic as past albums are. This album has a much more electronic feel than the previous 3 albums and it does suffer for it. The song-writing does not grab your attention as much and the songs aren't nearly as catchy. Its an average project for Gorillaz, but far more creative than most artists can drum up.\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Hillybilly Man\n2) Amarillo\n3) Revolving Doors\n4) Detroit\n5) The Snake in Dallas"

Most cites want flowers, and rainbow colored unicorns to be associated with their fair or even unfair city.  But the Standells has a difference esthetic view, a naive one but they loved their town and they sang about it frustrated women and all.  The song is about the grittier side of Boston and the dirty water of the River Charles.  It is a catchy song, and like the unpolished portrait of Boston the song portrays, the sound congers up a vision of four teens hammering out a tune in a cold garage.  Yep, there are the trashcans and in a minute the drummer will have to get up and haul them out to the curb.  Directly behind them is a tool/work bench with various tools and bits and pieces of things that are being saved because you never know when you are going to need rusted muffler for a 1961 lawn boy mower.  The boys have the door up and a gusty wind blows some autumn leaves in.  Their fingers are cold and it sometimes makes it hard to hit the cords crisply.  They have no intention to quit because each of them loves their town but they also have dreams of going beyond Boston.  They want to see sun-tanned California girls on the beech and dark Senoritas walking in bunches in the Cordoba Plaza on their way to the  Cruces de Mayo.  They have dreams of sitting and drinking coffee with pale french women smoking and talking of abuses of the government.  And I can hear this in the song and what I know that they didn't know is this song will carry them to the places they dream of and many more.  To Dick Dodd good-bye.  You recently relocated to the big mousetrap in the sky and you knew you would be received even if you did not wear white."

"2579","5","","B004XKMSCQ","843d25c8fb7e1025aa89f944d6cad135FUWS","I knew this was RedOne behind the board here, man... I just KNEW it. It's getting to seem like everything truly excellent (and new) in production these days is coming from RedOne -- and his creativity behind the board is on full display, here. RedOne isn't playing around anymore, that much is for sure: he's hunting for some monumentally massive numbers within the industry, and by the sound of this, he's going to get them.\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n1. I love the atmospherics ""pushing"" the song here. Long a feature in Euro-trance, I have wondered for ages when somebody would grab the concept and knock a single out of the ballpark with it on the US chart. Call this ""propulsive house"" if you like, but there's a bit of ""propulsive mariachi"" at work here as well, if you ask me. I don't know if there's even such a thing as ""propulsive mariachi,"" but if there is, then THIS is what it sounds like; I honestly thought this might break into 9/10th's time and go into a ""flamenco house"" at the break (there's no such thing as THAT either, but hey, feel free to sue me if it makes you feel any better). Using the synths as practically a separate drum track is LONG-overdue for use in a mass-market US single; this really should have preceded ON THE FLOOR in the initial push at radio for the album (it is slower, though... my ears have it at 120 BPM, while ON THE FLOOR strikes me as 130-ish (BPM)). I can kinda tell that you wanted to use higher-pitched tones for the bass-line here, while using the low end for traditionally higher-pitched melodic elements -- but I'll be damned if I can point to just where I think I hear that. One of these days you're gonna reverse them for real, and it's gonna be a MONSTER in club-land.\n\n2. Lopez's voice here is in fine form -- she sounds, to me, sharper... almost as if she's naturally in F (which she ain't). A part of that, of course, comes from the contrast against the key used here: my ears have this in E (minor), so Lopez here sounds sharper (by comparison); still, what I think I hear from her does sound true -- i.e., it wasn't done electronically... she does, simply, sound better... is what I'm trying to say. The vox here are sharp, energetic, and focused. RedOne is not only an Einstein behind the board, but he also gets the best, vocally, from Lopez (in my opinion, anyhow) in a good long while.\n\n3. All the usual good stuff applies, here: it's totally club-ready as-is, ringtones galore can be heard within it, and the re-mix potential is BEYOND massive. The (rapidly growing) Latin market is properly nailed (singing a few lines in Spanish towards the end feels absolutely correct), while the record still maintains a solidly mainstream US focii. I love the mariachi-sounding keys... and yeah, I know I already said that. The hook is ROYAL, man... the chorus is an instant earworm. The final result is MAJESTIC.\n\nProps, RedOne.\n\nYou brought out the best from the talent in front of you, and it's really a truly exceptional record. This is what a producer is supposed to be, folks: RedOne, YOU TOOK LOPEZ TO A PLACE WHERE SHE EXCEEDED HERSELF.\n\n5 stars, all around.\n\nSimply beyond massive."

Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.\n\nSong: D+"

Loud, passionate parts alternate with softer, more subtle moments, yet the song never feels uneven.

This set achieves that, in spades.\nYou know what a great orchestra performing a beautiful piece of music sounds like, yes? This set of Sibelius doesn't, to me, sound like that at all. No, it's more like sound rising up like mist from the ground and swirls around you as you walk through it. As if the music just appears and unfolds of its own volition, with no human involvement.\nLemminkainen, for example: one reviewer feels Lemminkainen in Tuolena is too slow, while another says the suite pales in comparison with the old Ormandy recording. I grew up with the Ormandy and I love it: it's an amazing, beautiful performance, a fitting valedictory to a long and illustrious career. Yet it still sounds like a performance, a wonderful orchestra playing a wonderful piece of music, whereas this Lemminkainen is like a dream unfolding. Kind of hard to explain the difference, I know.\nThe symphonies share this same organic feel."

They had songs across the spectrum, and this was as different as any of them. Unique to ""Killer Queen"" is how is lifted Queen up as a bad in a new place in rock.\n\nWith this song, they became more than a rock band. They were now art rock, classic rock, opera rock, and more. You'll find a touch of lounge, harmonies, a great solo by Brian May, tight drumming by Roger Taylor, and everything else you'd expect in a Queen tune.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com"

I'm unclear about their exact intent, but it could be either a commentary on the immigrant experience coming to America, or perhaps a more subtle commentary on today's ""broken"" America. Or perhaps about those that join the military because they have few other options.\n\n""...We speak in broken American, from the inlands to the shore\nThey tell us how the West was won, and what to fight for\nAnd they say they wouldn't send us far, and that most of us could stay\nWe speak in broken American, and we got the news today\n\nAnd now I've got to leave this place, oh, back to my sweet land\nOh, now I got to leave this place oh oh, back to my sweet land...""\n\n'Broken American' has a folk-rock sound and reminds me of music from the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simon-Garfunkel/dp/B0000026VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simon & Garfunkel</a>.

There's no mistaking this for a country or bluegrass tune, however.  Perhaps that's because of an underlying percussive beat that lends the song a distinctly rockin' energy.  Whatever it is, this unexpected sound is enough to capture a listener's interest.  Clearly Dispatch isn't a band that's afraid to think outside the box.\n\nThe lyrics speak enigmatically of the American immigrant experience: disillusionment, hardship, homesickness, and the struggle to belong.  This is the kind of song that's just as good to listen to whether you're giving it your full attention or you've just got it on in the background."

I had heard the song Amen and just about fell in love with Hannah Blaylock who's name Hannah fit's her because I thought she looked like Miley Cyrus.  Then it seemed like it took a long time for this cd to come out.  And when it finally did.  It is my choice for album of the year.  At least in my cd collection.  Amen turned out to be the only thing close to a hit that they had.  Hannah soon got married and the band dissolved.  Our loss.  There is not a bad song on here.  Swingin' Door, Last Supper the Gosphel Acapella Christ Alone are all super.  But as good as this cd is.  The song Cherry Pie makes it even better.  About all the people in your life who  have influenced you and made you the person you are.  And Cherry Pie is a horse so it is not only about people.  It get's me to thinking about my own life.

Let's listen to it.\n\n""Wreckin' Bar"" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  ""If You Wanna"" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  ""But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!""  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  ""Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!""\n\n""A Lack of Understanding"" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good ""I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand"".  ""Blow It Up"" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  ""Wetsuit"" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The ""ah ah ah"" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield ""I Only Want to Be With You"".  Pretty decent melody either way.  ""You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently"".  I love the part ""Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!""\n\n""Norgaard"" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  ""Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!"" is a funny line.  ""Post Break-Up Sex"" is another memorable rocker.  ""Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs""  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  ""Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?""  VERY clever lyrics!\n\n""Under Your Thumb"" is pretty decent pop/rock.  ""I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!""  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the ""Eleanor"" part in particular.  ""All In White"" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.\n\n""Wolf Pack"" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  ""Family Friend"" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. ""You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool""  Also love the line afterwards ""Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in"".\n\nThe hidden track, ""Somebody Else's Child"" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright."

I am a big fan of Billie Holiday, so I thought I'd give this version a try - and I am glad I did.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the performance.  Ms Spalding has a very sweet, clear voice that goes beautifully with the song.  It doesn't have the edginess of Billie Holiday's voice, but Ms Spalding adds a different kind of take on the song.  It's sweet and innocent rendition of the song, and she performs it beautifully.\n\nI highly recommend adding this song to your library."
"2854","4","3","B0051CBPW4","d5bb6232c8a5d56117369443a640efc9WUN5","There is no question that Billie Holliday is one of the most influentail vocalists of all time. But for newcomer Esperanza Spalding, she has been known to beat out a favorite in the crowd. After all, she was the one whom whipped Justin Beiber's moptop when she won Best New Artist at the Grammys this past year. But for those whom are new to her soulful voice, her cover of Billie Holliday's I'll Look Around from A Tribute To Billie Holliday actually is very intimate, and flows well to the classy voices of acts of today like Corrine Bailey Rae. I was pleasantly surprised, especially with her smooth blended style, added with the intimacy of hearing the voice of Billie saying how she grew up out of slavery, and made only a grand a week. This is a elequent download for your MP3 library, and a nice treat from the overexposed dance pop that has honestly gotten very tiresome from Lady Gaga & Rihanna lately. This is honestly worth a try.\n\nSong: B"
"2855","5","5","B0051CBPW4","f28eee98132cc58902283ff2d2ade14cBMX8","Here's a very nice Billie Holiday cover from Esperanza Spalding, who shocked the music world by winning the Best New Artist Grammy earlier this year (simultaneously angering thousands of Justin Bieber fans).  She has a lilting way with the song, sensuously wrapping her vocal tones around the notes.  Esperanza's bass playing is noteworthy as well, as she expertly coaxes the electric bass to produce some zesty lines throughout the song.  It's a fitting tribute to Billie Holiday, and also a good showcase for Ms Spalding's skills."
"2856","3","6","B0051CBPW4","73eccef7849a3b734c99b5c98fbda1b1V8T5","Covers of songs by famous artists are prone to suffer from one of two flaws: either the artist recording the cover is so eager to stamp it with his or her own style that the song is transformed into something utterly different (and usually far inferior to the original), or the cover is so blindly derivative as to be pointless and ultimately forgettable.\n\nEsperanza Spalding's cover of Billie Holiday's ""I'll Look Around"" gets it exactly right.  Compared to Holiday's version, which was filled with languorous yearning, Spalding's is a little smoother and more upbeat, bringing an almost whimsical note to this song of lost love.  The background is easy-listening jazz - it's the sort of thing you might expect to hear playing softly in a classy restaurant.  Spalding's voice is just as appealing, silky and fluidly sensuous.  This is an old-fashioned song with a timeless sound, and Spalding has made it her own for a modern audience.\n\nNo matter your tastes, this track is sure to add a touch of loveliness to your music collection.  It's easily worth a free download."

I saw the artist, Still Corners, in the credits. Went to Amazon Music, and looked it up. After listening to the preview, I bought this song.\n\nThe music is just soul stirring, the beat is solid and powerful, and Tessa's voice just brings it all together. As I said in the title of this review, this song is very tranquil. Very well composed. Not the typical electronic sound of most modern ""music"". It has a peaceful feel, almost as if you're floating through the song. Those who truly appreciate the art of music will know what that means. An excellent song, with great composition. I'd love to see Still Corners perform this live."

The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.\n\nI'm just glad this was free."

Nice clean opening drum and keyboard that stays throughout the song behind the robotic vocal and noises. Simple lyric, simple song sounds okay.\n\nNext up Short Order Cooks from Emil & Friends. Cool techno opening with weird noises then asexual vocal over same beat and various sounds. Stays interesting.\n\nTrack 3 is Rifle Men with His & Hers. Cool intro then hollow echo singer(s) over perky busy band playing one at a time(nearly) making great little song. Very nice. (song sounds vaguely familiar, cannot place it)\n\nGordon Voidwell with Ivy League Circus. Brutally unoriginal song with dated lyrics and simple 80's beat. You may love it.\n\nQueer Eyed Boy by Rumspringa. Rumspringa is the name for the time after an Amish kid reaches 16 and is allowed to party for a while. Nice alternative song great playing by the band and deliberate vocal. Good song.\n\nTrack 6 is Francis and the Lights playing Darling, It's Alright. Pretty cool vocal over clean band filling in the gaps. Nice production on neat sound.\n\nLast track is by Savoir Adore playing Bodies. Up beat song, nothing fancy, drums and vocals feature in this great little lite Alt. song.\n\nPretty much all Indie/Alternative music, not Rock more like Alt. Pop songs. Many sound fresh most are good tunes. Download all 7 tracks on to your massive hard drive give them a try, delete is easy. They may not be available for free for long."

Frampton Comes Alive! was a massive commercial success, staying at the top of the charts for 10 weeks. It was THE album of 1976.\n\nDo You Feel Like We Do is the final and longest track on the double live album. There is a momentary pause, the crowd waiting, then Frampton starts playing the classic opening riff. The rest of the band come in, bass, keyboards and drums.\n\nTo the audience, Frampton and his mates can do no wrong. It's like the crowd already know and love the album, even though it didn't exist yet. Maybe there were flashing CHEER and APPLAUSE signs? Perhaps they all owned and loved his studio album, Frampton's Camel? Nah, face it, Frampton was ON and he had them in the palm of his hand. It's great fun 70s rock, it sounds excellent, how could anyone not be having a blast at this show? Of course they feel like you do, Peter. You're the Pied Piper, Peter Piper.\n\nAfter the first couple of verses, Frampton plays a tasty little lick at 2:10, then kicks out a fantastic solo from 2:21-3:01. Following another verse and chorus, at 3:52 the music slides into a quiet middle section, featuring\n\nBob Mayo...on the keyboards, Bob Mayo, who plays a groovy solo from 4:12-5:17. Frampton starts asking the crowd, Do You Feel Like We Do...and, yes, I think they do. He solos again from 5:55-7:00.\n\nThen, wait...what's going on? I can't see what's happening on stage. The band are playing along together, the crowd is cheering. Peter must be mucking around with something. Oh right, he's getting his talk box effect thingamajig ready. It appears at 7:22, oo baydo baydo boo...crowd cheer...bah do wah bo baba dah...crowd cheer...Peter you sound funny, I wanna thank you...I hope you have a good night...don't forget to come again real real soon (not sure about this last part). Some of it must just be Frampton going wah wahwah woo wow uh.\n\nAt 11:25, Frampton ditches the talk box with a big Woahwoww...then pulls out all the stops for one more mighty solo at 11:45 that lasts until the end, sending the crowd into spasms of joy."

While listening to him, I was thinking he probably wouldn't do as well with Mozart (but I could be surprised - don't know), and indeed after looking into his discography, I can't see that he has recorded very much written before the 19th century. But his mind and fingers are programmed to zone into the great Romantic composers, and this survey of Rachmaninoff is truly some great stuff. The sonics are a bit uneven, but overall are acceptable. Highly recommended!"

Shonen Knife has covered it faithfully here, but not brought anything new to it.  Except for the female voices, there is very little difference between this cover and the original.  Shonen Knife presents the lyrics with a straightforward delivery that doesn't suit the song's fun-loving vibe; I get the feeling they were spitting the words out more than trying to capture their feel.  It's not bad, but there's absolutely nothing special here."
"3256","3","","B005935NNW","8ca0d2f66ed031c1b747c382a912b349SE1U","Shonen Knife has been around since 1981 and are well known for their poppy take on rock and roll. They were influenced by 1960s girl groups, pop bands, The Beach Boys, and early punk rock acts. ""Rock N Roll High School"" is a track from their latest album 'Osaka Romones - Tribute To The Ramones' (available only in MP3 format currently).  It is a cheerful version rather than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/angrier-original/dp/B00000JFUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">angrier original</a>&nbsp;and sounds like something you might hear while watching 'Teen Titans' or some other modern kids cartoon. They in fact have done soundtrack work and are on the Powerpuff Girls soundtrack 'Heroes and Villains'. So I'm not saying their rendition is bad ...just different.\n\nI like the song well enough, but it isn't something I'd play every day. The rest of 'Osaka Romones' sounds much the same, so if you like enjoy Shonen Knife's take on ""Rock N Roll High School"" and J-Pop in general, then you might want to add it to your Cloud Player and jam out with the three girls from Osaka.\n\n~ Kort-san"
"3257","4","8","B005935NNW","e4278936691be6ffe272fba83942dfcfP9AZ","I really love Shonen Knife. I haven't bought any of their records for many years now, but I have several and they are among my favorites from the late 1990s or so. Here they bring their particular brand of hybrid Japanese cuteness and toughness to this Ramone's classic, but in the end they stay pretty true to the original.\n\nAnd that's the problem that keeps this back from being among the best Shonen Knife material. Does anyone remember their cover of ""Top of the World"" by the Carpenters from the tribute album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/If-I-Were-a-Carpenter/dp/B000005IL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">If I Were a Carpenter</a>? That was brilliant because Shonen Knife brought their punk-inspired driving guitars and rhythms to a song that was originally from the opposite, laid-back, easy-listening end of the pop spectrum. The cover version actually had a transformative effect.\n\nHere, we have a nice cover version by a great band of a classic song by another great band, delivered in a highly similar style. Shonen Knife's affinity with the Ramones makes it tough for them to bring anything really new to the tune -- beyond the cuter, Japanese girl band voice and vibe.\n\nGood, glad to have it, but it doesn't go to 11 or anything."

Well, apparently for the members of Shonen Knife, their idols were the Ramones.  This track is a pretty faithful rendition of ""Rock 'n' Roll High School,"" with a few slight differences such as a greater presence of harmonies, and the lyrics are sung with a cute Japanese accent!  However, the Knife ladies also seem to have taken the bite and muscle out of this song, maybe because the guitars are more toned down or something.  The Ramones usually sounded ANGRY when they played and sang; these ladies merely sound like they're having fun.  It sorta robs the song of its power."

It's fun, but it grows weary before too long, a little frenzied in a controlled kind of way, just not controlled enough.  There are some interesting sounds and musical enhancements that add a layer of intrigue to the track, but they are compiled atop a rudimentary musical arrangement that gives Friedberger an almost dated feeling.  The horns at the end of the track are a nice touch, but they too don't really feel new or inspired.  They just serve to throw yet another trick in the bag.  It's decent and certainly has its moment, but overall this isn't as inspired as it is obviously trying to be.\n\nI can't say for certain that Eleanor wouldn't grow annoying after four or five tracks, but I'd be willing to give her a try."

It's a bright, energetic song, and Friedberger sings with an appealing earnestness, and the saxophone solo at the end is sensuous and lovely.  However, the music up to that point is rather reminiscent of the annoying synthetic sounds so often found in video games twenty years ago.  In small quantities that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's the sort of thing one has to be in the mood for.  As for the lyrics, Friedberger seems to be telling the story of getting into a car accident while mulling over her frustrations with an ex-lover, but it doesn't really make much sense and it's hard to tell what exactly is going on.  During the verses, the words seem to spill from her mouth in a jumbled torrent.  What does ""tube top and shorts with thighs cut, hold me down"" mean, exactly?  How about ""he's ignoring me like it's 2001""?\n\nIt's not a bad song, and its better moments have me thoroughly convinced of Friedberger's potential, but it has too many rough edges and irritating qualities to be as enjoyable as it might otherwise have been."

"3494","5","","B005C7N5VW","bc9f1440062d5a998aa5ddb6c6af239fUCFJ","From the opening notes of ""Wrecking Ball"", this CD is pure Terri Clark. it is an upbeat, rocking number with clever lyrics, driving guitar, with just enough fiddle. ""Breakin' Up Thing"" is about a guy with 'no respect for the human heart', it is a mid-tempo song with a smattering of pedal steel, not quite a kiss-off song, it is more from the side of the kissee. ""The One"" is a slower song, about what she wants in a relationship: 'I don't need a love that I can live with, I want the one I can't live without'. ""Northern Girl"" could be the anthem for a whole generation of young ladies from Canada! Four of the tracks were co-written with Kristen Hall, formerly of Sugarland, including my favorite: ""Beautiful and Broken"". I love the banjo and accordion. ""Lonesome's Last Call"" sounds straight out of 1978 with the weepy fiddle/pedal steel intro and story of two lonely souls who happen to find each other. A broken relationship is the story of ""The Good Was Great"". ""Smile"" is an emotional tribute to Clark's mother and features Alison Krauss, it put a lump in my throat. ""We're Here For a Good Time"" is a cover of the old Trooper song about having a good time, even when it's raining. The album closes with a Celtic-inspired song about the futility of planting ""Flowers in the Snow"". It's a shame that Terri Clark is not more popular, her music has so much more heart and depth than the other stuff being released to country radio right now."

Im taking the song to be an upbeat tune where he is expressing that the person he is singing about gives him an emotional/euphoric buzz and from the positive imagery of the video she is the perfect combo of being sweet (with his mentioning honey) but adding to his life through her multi-dimensional personality. Nonetheless, Drunk On You by Luke Bryan is definitely a well placed theme song to add to a cheery type of love playlist."

A consistent presence as a session and background singer in the Washington, DC independent music scene, her voice consistently falls into the pocket and effortlessly rides the modern rhythmic production waves of her atmospheric band, Third Logic. On sublime neo-funk compositions like 5:35 and You are the One, Bond kicks up her heels and parties on musical shores as sophisticated as they are fun. On jazzy electric-soul ballads, Bond coos like an island breeze across string-heavy, percussive neo-80s soundscapes that pulsate with the city sounds of champagne toasts and penthouse living. Throughout these moonlit rides, Bond and her band prove to be thinking musicians with an unfailing sense of maturity, place, and drive.\n\nIt feels liks an age since we last heard from singer/songwriter Debrah Bond on her 2003 debut, DayAfter, and its standout ballad, Sweet Lullabies. Her alto has grown lighter, surer, and more technically proficient since then. Refined from the ensuing years of supporting a virtual whos who of East Coast indy and mainstream soul from Kem and Ledisi to Frank McComb and Eric Roberson, Bond has come a long way in eight years, leaving fans only a remix of DayAfter to tide them over in the meantime.\n\nAiry voiced with a sultry resonance, on her sophomore project of original tunes, Bond - possessing her still youthful tones - does not always yield the most distinctive vocal presence as a soloist. But, her skill, brilliance, and efficiency is never less than awe-inspiring. The ease of the many transitions on Perfect is a technicians sleight of hand, making the difficult look effortless. Bonds deft hop-scotch handling of the tunes multi-syllabic phrasing and her perceptive nestling in the songs sweet spots making every moment count. In her vocal choices, Bond consistently reveals an intelligence that is understated, but hard to miss. With far less intricacies to maneuver through, she massages Think Twice and Never Was with a breezy beauty that a heavier voice would have made leaden. Her ample experience on backgrounds shines on every harmonic arrangement with voices rivaling Incognito and the Jones Girls on cuts like 5:35. Always appearing to glide over her subtle melodies, Bond is gifted at working hard without ever showing a seam.\n\nIf Bonds skill as a professional songstress wasn't worthy enough of eternal respect, she pulls off the coup of the century by excavating the M.I.A. cult legend Lewis Taylor, who hasn't been heard on a new recording since 2006, and then goes toe-to-toe with the eccentric star for every vocal riff, run and growl. The always pristine-voiced Taylor pulls a ferocity out of Bond on the track that would be nice to hear more of from the usually unflappable chanteuse. Warm and more blood-beating than the albums cooler illustrations, the mid-tempo guitar and percussion bumper is both a tease and a joy, leaving drooling listeners ravenous for more from this thoroughly edible duet.\n\nA cousin to the music of Foreign Exchange minus that band's melodrama, the hybrid Madame Palindrone fuses 90s acid jazz and 80s new age dance music with elements of modern day chillout, lounge, and progressive soul to create a series of briskly paced, though never rushed sonic moving pictures. The lockstep Third Logic musicians sacrifice themselves to mood and tempo, making only the most muted of individual impressions, like the discreet latin percussion and light spectral effects closing Say It or the fleeting bass, violins, and strings accenting Highest Mountain, all to moving effect. It is unobtrusive, atmospheric music that cannot help but light a candle, pour a glass, and set a seductive mood without ever being unseemly. Lyrically sound with less than obvious - but nonetheless compelling - choruses, Bond is more storyteller than hook-meister. Though a lack of singularity plagues Bonds profile as a signature soloist, the overall quality, impressive technique, and humble talent rolling through Madame Palindrone raises Deborah Bond to a circle of other elite, independent ladies whove made strong careers of riding urbane grooves, including: Julie Dexter, Conya Doss, and Amel Larrieux. Welcome to the big leagues, Madame Bond."

Or like some sort of vortex, or the Twilight Zone. If you were going to be stuck anywhere in northern California, it is most likely going to be Lodi. The narrator ends up there after riding in on a greyhound to do a gig, then his friends go missing, his promise of fame vanishes, and he ends up singing the same songs over and over, trying to save up enough money to buy a train ticket out of there. I have never been to Lodi, but it is apparently the ''Zinfandel Capital of the World."" You end up sipping some wine and before you know it you are a resident. I don't think the narrator thinks it's such a bad place, but it must be frustrating since he has been stuck there before. Like you are in a dream and you can't figure out how to wake up."

The background vocals are timed\nperfectly, they are beautiful, & they sound\nlike a church choir; Gospel in fact.\nThe title of this song is universal, the search\nfor love is something that we adults look for\nall the time. Yes, we want to know what LOVE is\nwhen we are hurt by what we thought LOVE\nwas. Especially when we gave, & feel we didn't\nreceive.. A Beautiful song that raises a life\nquestion that needs definition by faith in \nLOVE."

One of them was last year as winner of Dancing With The Stars. But musically, she hasn't really shown that she could sing more than she could chew. Her latest song Don't Hold Your Breath isn't really a song that feels exciting or well-displayed. She doesn't do enough to show that she can fully be seperated from her pussycat dolls days, and be taken more assertively as a solo act in the ways others' like Beyonce' have thrived. Nicole really needs to get something out to make it more of a ""wow factor."" She said she will have something out soon, but honestly what she has shown is more of a snoozefest that makes it worth holding your breath.\n\nSong: D+"

Tangerine Dream is an established electronic music collective, German decent.  I have since listened to a lot more or the bands art.  This is a great song, and I would highly recommend it, and, ""The Dream Is Always The Same"", if you can find it.

While so many have thought of One Sweet Day with Mariah Carey 16 years ago. But while the foursome, then trio have suffered in sales they did bounce back several years ago, they honestly could've brought more into their songs. Their latest sing More Than You'll Ever Know with Charlie Wilson isn't a bad collaboration from the two, but honestly not the best song they have made. Still it honestly is a better song than all the trashy music that is on radio right now. Hopefully, there will be more from Boyz II Men to celebrate.\n\nSong: C+"

Lou Reed strums a relaxed guitar, the drums are played with quietly swinging brushes. It feels like both an intimate after hours gathering on an empty, graffiti-covered subway car, and bedtime story hour at an 'adults only' bookstore. A lullaby for artistic freaks, fiends and friends living in a depraved and dirty, yet stimulating and inspiring city where anything goes. An ode to the characters who came to New York and became part of Andy Warhol's factory crowd. Top it all off with that fantastic saxophone from Ronnie Ross, and the train clickety clacks away down the tracks with dawn just showing in the east."

Released in 1972 (same year as Bread's ""Diary,"" a similar sad song), ""Last Song"" spent 18 weeks on the charts and peaked at number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. This was Edward Bear's most successful song; it centers on the singer's realization that his love, gone now for two years, is not coming back despite his keeping the lights on, hoping and longing for that return. Now, however, he understands that will not happen and so he writes and sings this ""last song"" for her. The time has come to close that chapter of his life, despite his continuing love for her. It's time to turn out the lights. A gently-sung piece, ""Last Song"" is entirely reminiscent of the feeling of the soft-rock 70's.\n\nEdward Bear is not a person's name; it's actually a three-man band, named for Winnie the Pooh, whose actual name is Edward Bear. A Canadian group, Edward Bear started out in 1966, completely unknown and performed at events, birthday parties, bars -- eventually getting noticed almost by accident and signed by Capital Records. The members were Larry Evoy, architect/keyboardist Paul Weldon, and guitarist Danny Marks. The band lasted twelve years all told. They produced four albums and four solid hits. At the end, there were apparently no conflicts or issues among the trio; they just decided they were through with this segment of their lives and wanted to do other things.\n\nIn 1995, Evoy received an award from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada for ""Last Song"" (and two other pieces) having been played on-air 100,000 times. On soft-rock stations, ""Last Song"" is still played, 44 years after its initial release!"

It debuted in most of the scenes with Atom's introduction to the ring, and the sight of the robot and his young owner/trainer entering the arena with a fun dance number were cute and added some levity to the film.  And while it isn't the type of music I normally listen to, those scenes left enough of an impression on me -- and the song got embedded deeply enough in my head -- that I decided to track down a copy.\n\n""Give It a Go"" is a heavy techno beat with heavily synthesized voices, almost like something Daft Punk might produce (only not as heavy on the synthesizer in the instrumentals).  It's unexpectedly fun and catchy, though, and one can't help but move along with the beat.  The singing isn't stellar and the female vocal seems to come out of nowhere, but otherwise it's a good number and could work well as a club or workout song.\n\nNot great, but a decent song from a good movie, and guaranteed to get the blood pumping.  As mentioned before, a good song to have playing in your headphones while you do your workout."

Of all of the hundreds of vocal versions of the Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer composition, ""Moon River"", over the years, perhaps the simplest, most effective, and affecting is the very first version which was sung by Audrey Hepburn. Strumming her guitar with violins and celeste in the background during 'the fire escape scene' with George Peppard in the movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", she nailed it vocally. And the song was in danger of being cut from the movie until Mancini and especially Hepburn fought hard to keep it in and, as they say, the rest is history: winning 2 Grammies for Song and Record of the Year, an Oscar, and enjoying great popularity ever since. Sung simply and sweetly, Hepburn is excellent in telling her believable tale about love, hope, wonder, and a river, in one pass through the lyrics. Mancini himself calls this his favorite version of the song. ""My huckleberry friend"", indeed! My Highest Recommendation. Five MEMORABLE Stars. (RCA Victor records. Steel music. 1-remastered MP3 track. Time-2:01.)"

Just months earlier the group's manager George Treadwell had disbanded the existing Drifters group and brought in The Five Crowns and renamed that group The Drifters. These ""new"" Drifters were led by a dynamic young lead vocalist named Ben E King and included Charlie Thomas who continues to perform Drifters tunes to this day. The move proved to be a stroke of genius as over the next 5 years The Drifters would prove to be a wildly successful recording act. ""There Goes My Baby"" would spend 19 weeks on the charts peaking at #2 in the summer of 1959. Produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, it was one of the first R&B records ever to use strings."

Larry Knechtel, a member of the Wrecking Crew, plays piano. It was inspired by a song from the gospel group the Swan Silvertones. It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.\n\nIt is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon. Supremely moving."

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Because Amazon allows you to sample nearly every song/album that they offer. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads. Free songs...even free albums. And more important than free. LEGAL. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first. No review will help you make a better decision than doing that. I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned. However, the freebie selection on Amazon is constantly changing, so by the time you read this review, it may have a price attached. If you are only in the market for freebies, I can make that super easy!\n\nCurrent selection of FREE AMAZON SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nCurrent selection of FREE AMAZON ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

At the same time it is not Country but rather an irreverent portrayal of a Country song playing upon Country song stereotypes. You can take this song very seriously and perhaps even stew at its irreverence or you can just sit back and chuckle at Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for their purposely overdone cuts on the Some Girls album. I prefer to do the latter."

Her piano is so expressive and gentle, that we become swept up in the emotion.  On ""A Chance for Goodbye,"" the mood is so sweetly melancholy that for me it brings up feelings of loss of a loved one whose remembrance is touching and whose absence is bittersweet.  ""On the Wings of Light"" reflects a hopeful mood, perhaps the start of a voyage.  ""October Sky"" is lovely and wistful.  Randy Yoder's cover photography is the perfect visual image of this music: beautiful & elegant.  Sweeten's musical style is similar throughout the disc; I might have hoped for a couple compositions with more pep and several with more variation in time structure, but this music has a wonderful place.  It's pastoral and combines restraint with grace.  Enjoy!"

In fact, I'll send my minister friend a copy of this review sometime. My father was a minister, and I believe he would have approved also. I will admit that both my Dad and my last minister were very liberal ministers in very liberal denominations.\n\nWherever two or more of you are gathered in My name, there I am with you !!! When  I am listening to hymns, I am listening to words from the heart of the lyricist, and music from the brain of the composer, so three of us are gathered together, even if two of them might be in Heaven, too.\n\nI have yet to find a Hymn collection that I couldn't give five stars to.

Referring in this case to the repeating of a formula that worked so well on her previous CD and applying it again with the same stellar results, perhaps even better. The elements of that alchemy include Kathryn's evocative compositions and grand piano expressions, produced by Grammy-winning Windham Hill founder Will Ackerman at his Imaginary Roads studio in Vermont, with mastering by Corin Nelsen, and a new addition to the team, recording engineer Tom Eaton. And last but not least, the accompaniment of a number of world-class studio musicians, some of whom graced her first album.\n\nSome of Kathryn's compositions, for me, are like musical portraits that evoke the earthy ambience and subtle shadings of an Andrew Wyeth painting. The opening track, a sweet piano solo, entitled ""Mountain Laurel"" is a perfect example. Within its' serenely sylvan melody is revealed a depth for those with ears to hear. The nature theme continues on the second track, ""Meadow Morning,"" which is peaceful and pensive, but with a touch of wistfulness in the air. This is one of the larger ensemble pieces, yet it's understated interplay maintains the delicate demeanor that characterizes the album.\n\nAs pastoral as Kathryn's music can be, she also ventures into other landscapes, such as the decidedly more urban vista of ""An Empty Street In Prague."" The music so perfectly captures the essence of the title that it is hard not to feel like you are there, your lone footsteps echoing down the cobblestone corridor of the city. The title of ""How Deep, How Simple"" mirrors some of the qualities of Kathryn's music, with its reflective melodies that are unpretentious on the surface while illuminating deep waters below. Speaking of titles, the music on the title track ""Heavy As A Feather"" does a wonderful job of depicting a portrait in sound that has a lightness of being yet is counterbalanced by a subtle sense of gravity. Although there has been no mention (yet) with regard to the next CD, it is unlikely that Kathryn's fans will cease calling for an encore until she obliges and paints yet another haunting musical masterpiece in colors of earth and sky."

It is like the flight of a small multicolored butterfly which flies from one beautiful flower to another on the lush Summer meadow. This music is overflowing with tenderness, compassion and forgiveness. When you listen to this project you realize what a joy to be here on this Earth and you want to stay here as long as possible in harmony and creativity.\n\nIt is not necessary to think how the artist achieves such a perfect sounding and deepest emotional impact of her performance. You just want to listen to the music of Kathryn Kaye and to recover your heart because the compositions of this project possess a strong healing effect.\n\nI would like only to mention in short that ""Heavy as a Feather"" is the second CD of Kathryn Kaye. Like the first album this project was produced by Will Ackerman at his famous Imaginary Road Studios in Windham County, Vermont. And, as it was on the first CD the team of outstanding artists helps Kathryn to record the second one.\n\n""Heavy as a Feather"" shows the obvious progress of Kathryn Kaye as an acoustic instrumental and new age music performer. The album discovers new facets of her talent. This music appeals to the highest aspirations of your soul. It awakens the yearning for love and beauty.\n\nWhat will you feel when the music of ""Heavy as a Feather"" ends? You just want to live and to create and maybe to listen to this project once again.\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]"

And her musical collaborators provide solid support without ever upstaging the proceedings.\n\nThe result is a delightfully rich and engaging concoction that is a sight for sore ears."

It has just continued to grow and grow on me to the point where I consider it a marvelous folk contribution to modern music.  The lyrical content, fresh and exciting and provoking, meshes beautifully with the simplistic guitar strums that only highlight to intimate nature of the track.  The sharp baritone vocals are powerful and yet they are blemished and so authentic.  This is like a southern rock take on Mumford and Sons, laying everything back with a more restrained approach to modern folk music.  When you close your eyes you can feel the wood planks under your feet and you can smell the rich smell of the bayou bringing you to a comfortable place that enriches its pain with the swells of home.\n\nLike I said, I'm in love."

Quirky but oh so good. Now comes the band's 3rd album.\n\n""Smart Flesh"" (11 tracks; 46 min.) continues the band's exploration of Americana music, and then some. The opener ""Ghost Woman Blues"" (don't let the blues reference fool you) sets the table for the album. ""Boeing 737"" is about the only harder-charging track on here (and also the shortest song on the album, under 3 min.). After that it's back to the slow and softer music, not that this is a complaint. Check out the beautiful and pensive instrumental ""Wire"", for one. As the album goes on, it becomes clear that this is a mood piece, much more so than the band's previous output. If you're in the mood for it, it'll play great. I myself love it.\n\nI saw The Low Anthem again (saw them at Bonnaroo in 2009 support of the ""Oh My God"" album) recently at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, and what a show that was. Playing in almost darkness, the band brought many of the songs from this album, along with a couple of tracks from their earlier output. You could hear a pin drop when they were playing some of their quieter songs, just fantastic. I was equally amazed at the band's musical flexibility, with band members moving around from one musical instrument to another, just wow. Meanwhile, ""Smart Flesh"" is highly recommended!"

I found this CD to be somewhat haunting and sometimes beautiful, but also very depressing. It's not something I will play very often. The production is interesting...almost like it was recorded in a big empty warehouse rather than a studio. Not for everybody, but it does sound authentic. You might want to check 'em out if you like Dylan, Leonard Cohen or the more subdued side of Bright Eyes."

Prison Break sounds like a remix of a theme song for professional wrestling. Fateless sounds like war broke out in the winds of a hurricane.

Probably so, so I will write this review to tell you that you do need this song. It isn't the only worthwhile Springsteen hit for Springsteen is one of the greatest songwriters of our time. You may remember the Manfred Man Earth Band;s hit, ""Blinded By The Light."" That song was actually written by Bruce Springsteen. Not many have connected with young people of the 70s and 80s and their lifestyle, their hopes and dreams and fears quite like Springsteen. This is a great song, but don't stop with it and be sure to read his lyrics when you listen to his music."

In a long and successful career he has had a ton of hits that stand out among some of the greatest hits in rock music. The best of his best to me has to be ""Born To Run"". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the ""Boss"" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song. That to me is what makes this song so good. If there is only one Bruce Springsteen song you could download on to your MP3 player this would be that song."

Some of Leona's songs work (Bleeding Love, Better In Time, Brave, I Will Be, her cover of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face) and some of them don't. This one does. It feels like you are at a party when listening to this track. I heard it before when listening to her tracks for her second album on Youtube a few years back but then I recently heard this song again on Last.fm radio and was really, really hooked. I like fell in love with her all over again.\n\nLeona kind of frustrates me sometimes though. She's got the beauty, the talent and the vocal chops but some of her material is boring. I think she could be really, really big if she brought most of her material home on a really, really good album. I heard most of her first album and her whole second album and liked songs on both, but wasn't sold as a whole on either. But I believe in her potential. She's just gotta dig a bit deeper.\n\n4 stars."

But for her latest single from her sophmore album, Echo, I Got You, she tries to bring in more of a pop-driven melody than being a sultry and soulful torch singer as a departure from her earlier songs like Bleeding Love and Happy. Unfortunately, the song isn't really as strong for Leona as she has shown with her earlier tracks. While it honestly isn't her best song, it still has a nice rhythm. But, if you really want to download a great Leona song, stick with Better In Time instead. Hopefully, for her next single from Echo, Leona can bring out something a bit more driven and vibrant.\n\nSong: C"

I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a ""try-before-I-buy"" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.\n\nThis may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.\n\nEvery one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the ""St. Matthew Passion"" and St. John Passion"" especially lethargic and monotonous.\n\nThere are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Bach-2CDs/dp/B000W0B1CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Bach (2CDs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-x-Bach/dp/B00P3CEUXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 x Bach</a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.\n\nBottom line: ""100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces"" is a non-starter at any price. Not recommended."

Her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary. But, unfortunately her music hasn't really hit the home run in her recent records, and with more of her life the past few years on her marriage to Guy Richie ending, and her adopting African babies, she hasn't been able to really deliver to the big hits. That simple is also the case with Celebration, the new single from Madonna's upcoming anthology from her success with the Warner Brothers era. The song sadly doesn't really deliver the same spark Madonna had delivered throughout her past 26 years. The song sadly is not Madonna at her best. It feels like she doesn't hit that nail on the head, as we've heard from her last few records. While she has been known as the material girl, her material needs to be more fine-tuned when she does deliver her next studio album.\n\nSong: D+"

After 1992 and the grunge invasion, most hair metal bands split into three categories: some stuck to their guns and kept releasing albums in that style (FireHouse, Slaughter, etc), others split up and were never heard from again, and others attempted to embrace the grunge sound and release music in that vein. ""Insanity Beach"" is more of the latter; there are only a couple of songs that would sound similar to the band's earlier work. Instead of going full on grunge, however, Sleeze Beez pulled a Skid Row and just made their sound grittier. As a result, most of the songs don't have hooks, and it's hard to distinguish between them at times. There are some highlights however, as this album contains one or two of the band's best songs. If you like ""Slave to the Grind"" and ""Subhuman Race"" by Skid Row, you'll like this album. It's sound is kind of a mix between those two albums. The party rock may be long gone, but this is still a good listen."
"5385","4","","B0070OEGHW","1823a8a83a3faafbfe1e290845b0830dDHL1","Sleeze Beez were another in the long list of decent bands from the late 80's/early 90's that never achieved the success they deserved. While they had everything needed to succeed, for whatever reason, they just never got there.\n\n""Insanity Beach"" is Sleeze Beez's third and final album. With the release of ""Insanity Beach"", Sleeze Beez took a more harder rocking approach than with their previous releases. Gone is the Def Leppard sound alikes, and in it's place is a more modern hard rock sound. Now don't get me wrong, this album still has that Sleeze Beez sound, it just doesn't have that over-the-top catchiness that ""Screwed, Blued & Tattoed"" and ""Powertool"" had. The album does contain some filler, but the good far outweighed the bad. My favorite tracks from the album are ""Tell It To The Judge"", ""The Long Goodbye"", ""Save Myself"", ""Scream"" and ""Gun Culture"".\n\nThe worst thing about this album is, it's almost non-existent for some reason. I know it was released only in Japan, but come on, where in the world is Rock Candy or Wounded Bird??? Thankfully Amazon.com has it for download for a reasonable price, otherwise most people would never get to hear this great record."

And while I have yet to watch ""Highlander"" (I know, I'm a bad nerd...), I heard snippets of the song made famous by it, and decided it was worth a download.\n\nWhile not Queen's most famous song, ""Princes of the Universe"" is a fantastic song by the band, and deserves to be more well-known.  It has the signature Queen sound, part rock and part metal, and all energetic and blood-pumping.  The lyrics get a little lost in the instrumentation from time to time, but if you listen carefully the song is sung from the point of view of one of the film's immortal warriors.  And thankfully, one doesn't have to be familiar with the movie to enjoy said lyrics.\n\nA must-have track if you're a Queen fan, but also worth a listen if you're only casually familiar with them.

Which is something many of today's singers do not have and neither they will try. Hard to believe that it has been 35 years since he made his debut as a part of Wham, and his world really changed. But he has done so many remarkable covers over the years. He showed that throughout his career on his own by covering artists from Bonnie Raitt to Terence Trent D'Arby a few years ago for with Let Her Down Easy for his Symphonica album. But he has covered Stevie Wonder for years for so many of his albums and b-sides. His rendition of As with Mary J. Blige is one of those underrated covers that is really a hidden gem of George's. The song actually was a U.K. exclusive for his 1998 hits compilation, Ladies & Gentleman: The Best Of George Michael. The song is definitely a lovely song to listen to, and definitely worth every note. He really showed that he and Mary really do have a lot of chemistry worth listening to. It really was never recognized in America by die hard George Michael fans, as was the case with Outside back in 1998, but honestly the song definitely is joyous and very soulful. If you have loved George's duets over the years like Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with Elton John, than you'll absolutely love this song.\n\nSong: B+"

With instrumentals like Burt Kaempfert's ""Wonderland By Night"" and Lawrence Welk's ""Calcutta"" topping the charts American teenagers were casting about looking for exciting new sounds to latch on to. In February 1961 the New York based disc jockey Murray ""The K"" Kaufman secured a copy of a recording session tape made by an unknown Pittsburgh based doo-wop group called The Marcels. The group had just signed with the recently-launched Colpix label in NYC. What Murray the K heard that day was the wildest version of the Rogers & Hart standard ""Blue Moon"" that had ever been attempted to that point. He was positively captivated by the tune and without telling either the record company or the group he began playing it over and over again on his show. Realizing they had a huge hit on their hands Colpix rush-released the single in the final days of February, ""Blue Moon"" reached #1 in New York City in just one short week and was topping the charts nationwide inside of a month. ""Blue Moon"" continues to be one of the most beloved oldies of all-time.  This is the historic hit recording you would remember from the radio."

I loved it but it gets three stars for two reasons. The first is the length,, it leaves you wanting too much more - but that might be a good thing\n\nThe second is that the track entitled ""little hitlers"" seems to be a word-for-word copy of an earlier Louis C.K skit.\n\nAside from those two things - five stars. His skit on old school rap is especially hilarious."

I laughed so hard tears ran down my cheeks! I look forward to another stand up show from this ultra talented young man. Donald Glover covered almost all current topics, from racial issues, family memories over a smore chocolate, and the meaning of the word nigglet! Lol. You will not be disappointed with this stellar comedy show. I like his calm demeanor and voice impressions too. Most people know Donald Glover from either the critically acclaimed show ""30 Rock"", or you may know him from his rap career under the name of Childish Gambino. Honestly watching this comedy stand up ""weirdo"" is the first time I have ever heard of him(Donald Glover). I recently checked out his rap albums ""Because the internet"" and ""Royalty"". I must say I was thoroughly impressed with Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino's music. Versatile, witty, and funny beyond measure, Donald Glover's is a truly talented weirdo for sure. Check this entertaining show out and laugh your butt off.  Peace"

Musically, all the hype she had brought out, turned out to be a absolute failure with her album MDNA. Her lead single from her latest work, and her first after leaving Warner Brother Give Me All Your Lovin' isn't exactly a driven song. It feels like and sounds like Madonna doesn't actually have anything to prove within her voice and sound, especially when trying to reinvent herself for a whole new generation of fans. I think she could've brought more into the song, and doesn't feel like convincing from her voice alone. Hopefully, there is better songs from her to give all your loving to.\n\nSong: D+"

Mine is that the song, itself, sounds mostly the same all the way through.\n\nIt's a high energy rock song.  It starts with a wall of guitar sound that remains mostly unchanged through the first 2/3 of the song.  High energy drums.  But dynamic; there is no rise or fall in volume level; pretty much just loud all the way up to that 2/3.  While there are chord changes, the wall of guitar at the beginning has a way of hiding them.\n\nObviously this song did not do much for me, even though I'm a fan of many kinds of music.\n\nThen again, for people who like this kind of music, this is just the sort of music they'd like! ;-)"

I also like the message of this song.  For Pump fitness instructors, this one is highly recommended.  It starts slow (slow lifts/releases), then progresses into the faster pace (2-count, pulse, single reps, etc.), and ends with a fade (hold last rep).  Highly recommended."

It looked for all the world like a star was born. Unfortunately, although she hit the Hot 100 eight more times over the next several years she could never come close to equaling the success of ""Good Thing"". Although it turns out that she was a ""one hit wonder"" this is a song definitely one worth remembering.

It's an airy love song about a girl who is waiting for a call from a guy she really likes and had a good time with the night before, but isn't sure if he feels the same way.  Lead singer, Amy Heidemann's sweet vocals helped make the song a winner.  What was interesting, though was her briefly dabbling in a few rap lyrics during the song.  Far from being a gimmick, Amy (who is about looks about as hip hop as Weird Al Yankovic sounds Barry White) actually has quite a talent for rapping.\n\n  In this follow-up song, ""Hello"", her raps make up a much larger portion of the song.  When combined with her edgier singing voice in the lyrics, it feels like a wholly different musical experience.  If your first exposure to Karmin has been to listen to ""Hello"" without even having seen the video, the group would not be as you pictured.  Two good hits already have me looking forward to what Karmin does next."

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's ""Forget Him"" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again."

I've always had an affinity for this song, though. Rydell was one of the few ""teen idols"" of the '50s--i.e., Fabian, Frankie Avalon, Jimmy Clanton--who could actually sing, and he does a good job here. Very pleasant song, well done by Rydell (and it's NOT a re-record)."

It came out between my sophomore and junior year in high school and caused me to break a bad habit so I could go after a girl I met in my sophomore English class. Unfortunately (or fortunately) in my junior English class I realized that her beautiful blonde hair was courtesy of Madam Clairol when she went too long between visits to Madam Clairol. But this song has stuck with me forever and I have applied it several women since including the young woman who became my wife who was such a non-Clairol Blonde when we first met that I did not believe she was not a Clairol Blonde for several months. We were never closer than 150 miles during our dating/courtship until we got married. Summers were were much further apart. So this song has a LOT of meaning for me."

But Good Time Comin' On, Goodbye California, Whiskey, and King Of Apology are also very good.  Her voice goes well with a song like Whiskey.

The boys grew up listening to the R & B groups of the 1950s. The sounds of groups like The Moonglows, The Heartbeats, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers would have a profound influence on founding group members Charlie and Rich Ingui.\n\nIn the mid 1960's The Soul Survivors began to build a strong following, playing venues in Atlantic City and Philadelphia. Enjoying great success in Philadelphia, they attracted the attention of record producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Into the recording studio they went, emerging with "" Expressway To Your Heart "" a song that would climb to #3 on Billboard's R&B chart and #4 on the Hot 100 Singles pop chart. The success of ""Expressway"" would become Gamble and Huff's first ""crossover"" hit when it began to be played on both black and white radio stations.\n\nIn polls taken by both the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphias City Paper, "" Expressway"" was voted the number one record ever to come out of Philadelphia.  It's easy to see why."

The thing is, though, THE SEER is not equally superb throughout.  The second disc is just amazing, so don't be too hasty to form your opinion after only hearing Disc One.  The opening track (Lunacy) is fairly light, and there is a clear minimalist influence.  Then Disc Two shoots us screaming into space on a dark, psychedelic voyage!\n\nMichael Gira's reformed Swans are more powerful than ever.  The more recent TO BE KIND (2014) is more consistent than THE SEER -- it's stronger throughout -- but it does not reach the same heights.\n\nThe music of Michael Gira and Swans is raw, visionary and uncompromising.  His vocals remind of both Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, but the music is sui generis.  Listening is like plugging your mind directly into the black hole at the heart of the galaxy."

Dweles song catalog has always showcased the stages of love, but his sixth release, Greater Than One, delves deeper into murkier temptations and territories, using rich melodies, heightened harmonies and lucid lyrics to encapsulate a desire to commit without sacrificing the cool factor in the process.\n\nIf long-time fans or Dwele-come-lately listeners had high expectations due to his spectacular 2010 project, W.ants W.orld W.omen, the multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter doesnt disappoint: theres less bombast and boom-bap than on W.ants, since a distinctively 80s aura dominates this set, but its range is just as emotive and exciting.  Never one to phone in, the prolific Dwele writes or co-writes ten of the thirteen tracks while working the drum kit, keys and horns. Monica Blaire, Raheem DeVaughn, J Tait, L Renee and one-man hit machine Mike City contribute just enough of their talents to embellish Greater  without overtaking its direction.\n\nAs the opening interlude demonstrates, the 30+ performer is coming to terms with relinquishing the player card, but is not quite ready for rings, kids and SUVs just yet, a brutal truth that he paid dearly for in the bittersweet, horn-laden jazzy soul hybrid Going Leaving: She wanted more but I wasn't ready, me keepin it real made her heart heavy. I can admit it, scared me when she said where is this go-ING, I said Im not rea-DY, now shes leav-ING.she wants chil-DREN, OOOH.  One of the Mike City joints, the single What Profit, offers up syncopated rhythms and guitar-anchored grit on a cautionary tale about deserting your baby for the bling after getting large: Deep inside your mind down to the depths of your soul/you see love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes. What profit a man to gain the whole world, but lose his girl. If I were your man, Id do all I can, to keep you Girl.\n\nJust as a relationship can arc outward as deeper emotions take root, the songs on Greater. ripple and resonate as Dwele wades into deeper levels of honesty and oneness. Takes22Tango is a sinuous and salty exploration of a love that has potential to steal the show when they get their vertical rhythm right, and Raheem DeVaughn helps to double-down on the give-her-good-love or else message during the mellow, but mesmerizing What You Gotta Do. Another intriguing track is Obey, with Dweles tenor solemnly promising happily-ever-after as synthesized notes swell and surge beneath a fragile reunion.  This Love is a 180-degree turn-around and a likely culmination at the jewelry store, jubilant and flush with affectionate awe for his newly-christened missus.\n\nDwele may be contemplating future monogamy, but the present still leaves room for partying, heard on the glib Must Be while trading verses with Black Milk, LRenee and J. Tait about the chaos that occurs when we aint sober and as hes wading through a Love Triangle, a folly that clicked into place after two friends with eyes for Dwele decide to..well, you can guess. Patrick Ronald (which mustve been conceived after a Prince/The Time music marathon) is a club cut paying homage to the stomach-scraping beverage known as Patron that even allows Dwele to drop a few bars: That girl, she lookin good/ she came up on me talmbout whassup I said my wood,/ sorry, thats Patrick talkin. Frankly My Dear (Im Bennett I Aint Innit) closes with repentance when as he plays tug-of-war with his lust and his logic after discovering that last nights companion has a man: But you sure is fine, and right now you're mine/I should just be hesitant and use my common sense. On my shoulders theres a good head, but I keep using my (bleeped out) instead.\n\nIn the decade since his self-distributed debut Rize, Dwele couldve stagnated within the neo-soul niche or chased bigger name recognition by dropping simpler and sex-starved R&B, but the Detroit native continues to evolve, fearlessly melding expansive lyrical insights with his masterful sense of musicality, making this CD an essential purchase and one of the Greater contemporary soul releases of 2012."

Musically, they have been absent from the scene for a long time, while Steven Tyler did well on his brief stint on American Idol. But for the group, they are trying again with What Could Have Been Love from their album Music from Another Dimension. The song feels like a throwback to the ballads that Aerosmith had that were strong back in the 90's like Crazy and Cryin'. The song isn't a bad song, but honestly not as driven as their other songs had shown before. I really am eager to hear what is next for Aerosmith from their what their next single is going to be. What Could Have Been Love is not Aerosmith's best, but is better than a lot of the joke artists like Rihanna and Katy Perry have came out with.\n\nSong: B-"

Steven Tyler & company have parted for a long time while Steven has had his gig with American Idol and Jennifer Lopez. But honestly, hard core Aerosmith fans have wanted something even more, new music. There is so much awaiting with What Could Have Been Love, the lead single from Aerosmith's Music From Another Dimension album. The song is not bad, a straight-forward and simple throwback to Aersmith's earlier ballads from the 80's and 90's in tone. It doesn't drive up to those earlier songs the bad boys from Boston have made years earlier like Cryin' and I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing. But it is better than most of the cheap and cheesy music from acts like Katy Perry and Rihanna have made for the past several years. Hopefully, we will hear better when Music From Another Dimension comes out soon.\n\nSong: B-"

Usually people know what they are buying at least through a sample but this song is very good for those of us that have listened to ZZ Top since the 70's and HATE what the 80's and 90's did with them.\n\nThe song is about smoking meth from my best understanding, which I think is a stupid thing to do. You have to be an idiot to do use meth. But there are many historical songs about drug use that are not promoting the behavior, and I suspect this is one of those songs...just making an example of the behavior, not promoting it. These guys are so old, a hit of meth would kill any one of them, so I think they know that.\n\nYou have to get in to the mental weeds to understand all that, especially since the lyrics are about as seemingly random as can be and make virtually no sense...pretty much like the words of a meth head, which I think is the point of the song.\n\nDo not use illegal drugs especially idiotic drugs like meth. It will turn you in to an idiot if you actually survive.\n\nAll that said, this is a good song."

Professional recording artist Heidi Breyer's 2012 release Beyond the Turning features 14 eloquent piano instrumental songs. This is her third album, and follow-up to Another Place and Time, an album produced by founder of Windham Hill Records, Will Ackerman. Another Place and Time earned Heidi 2 ZMR Awards in 2010 for Best New Artist & Best Instrumental Piano Album.\n\nBeyond the Turning, produced by GRAMMY Winning producer and engineer Corin Nelsen, is another magnificent testimonial to the talents of composing pianist Heidi Breyer. An elemental variation in moods and influences is what makes Beyond the Turning shine from the rest. Artists include Eugene Friesen, Charlie Bisharat, Samite, Michael Manring, Steve Holley, Jeff Haynes, Jill Haley and David Cullen."
"6841","5","","B00949Y47I","8927944f9170620db16f51af1f812a64OSYP","Heidi Breyer's ""Beyond the Turning"" is a delightful set.  The opener ""Farewell"" with David Cullen's electric guitar is breathtakingly moving.  On the second track ""World Without End,"" Eugene Friesen's cello gives such depth in counterpoint to Heidi's gorgeous piano melody.  ""Eight steps free"" is another delightful track that opens with the lyricon (sounds like a penny whistle to me); it's ethereal and beautiful.  Janis Ian penned ""Tea & Sympathy"" that was on her 1975 album ""Between the Lines"" which transforms under Heidi's touch into a soft lullaby with her gentle vocals hugging the lovely melody.  ""Moondancing"" is a lovely soft piece that is given a major jazz inflection with Premik Russell-Tubbs' saxophone.  ""Beyond the Turning"" works well as a largely new age instrumental offering because of the great variety in instruments, superb musicianship and Heidi's inspired performance.  Enjoy!"
"6842","5","","B00949Y47I","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Beyond the Turning"" is pianist/composer Heidi Breyer's third album to date, following her award-winning and critically-acclaimed 2010 release, ""Another Place and Time."" Like her previous album, the fourteen tracks on ""Beyond the Turning"" are a varied mix of styles that contain elements of classical, jazz, folk, new age, and pop music blended to create Heidi Breyer's unique voice and vision. The other musicians on the album are as varied as the music and bring an eclectic sound to the mix. Breyer adds her delicate vocals to the two cover tunes and presents her first ever recorded improvisation (""The Long Way Home, Passages 1-3""), making this album a musical and emotional journey.\n\n""Beyond the Turning"" opens with ""Farewell,"" a piece that contains one of the album's biggest surprises. Beginning as a heartfelt piano solo, I was blown away when David Cullen's electric guitar entered at about the halfway point. Breyer heard this piece as a piano and electric guitar duet when she wrote it and refused to compromise on the unique combination of instruments. I wasn't sure I liked that combination at first, but Cullen's passionate playing communicates so well and contrasts so dramatically with the piano that it won me over. ""World Without End"" was inspired by a painting by Alexander Volkov. This is actually the third version of this piece, which Breyer concedes may never be completely finished. Her piano, Eugene Friesen's cello, and Samite's vocals give it a hauntingly beautiful expression. ""My Peace Piece"" is a piano solo dedicated to jazz pianist Bill Evans. Slow, fluid, and very graceful, this one's a favorite. So is ""Rive Droite,"" which features the violin artistry of the amazing Charlie Bisharat and Bob Colwell on accordion in addition to Breyer's rhythmic and sensual piano. I also really like ""Eight Steps Free,"" a duet for piano and lyricon (an electronic wind instrument with a very ethereal quality) played by Premik Russell-Tubbs. ""Tea and Sympathy"" is an arrangement of one of Janis Ian's classics. Guitar, piano, and bass are a simple but very effective accompaniment to Breyer's heartfelt vocals and Ian's poetic lyrics. ""Moondancing"" was an experiment in rhythm and is the first of Breyer's pieces with percussion (tam-tam). Russell-Tubbs' soulful saxophone adds the  perfect emotional element and makes it soar. The title track is a gorgeous duet for piano and English horn (Jill Haley) that expresses the realization that there are so many turns in the roads we travel in life, often wondering what lies ""beyond the turning,"" and the inner peace that comes with the acceptance that the turning happens every day and letting it flow through us.\n\nRecommended!"

You are not able to go away without continuing to hear this incredible music. Heidi Breyer returns with a new unbelievably wonderful 3rd project ""Beyond the Turning"".\n\nIt reminds us that life is a long road and invites us to move along on this exciting journey.\n\nWhat is the first impression of the new album of Heidi Breyer? Her piano music is filled with warmth and sincerity. These melodies are born from the bottom of the artist's heart. Their cordiality and easiness thrill the listener's heart.\n\nBut the emotional impact is not the only memorable feature of ""Beyond the Turning"". The music of Heidi Breyer is perfectly composed and arranged. Her newest project was produced by renowned sound engineer Corin Nelsen. The result of his work is the refined sound of the ""Beyond the Turning"".\n\nThe masters of acoustic instruments such as David Cullen (electric guitar), Eugene Friesen (cello), Charlie Bisharat (violin), Michael Manring (fretless bass) along with many other brilliant performers including tremendous ethnic vocals by Samite help to create the unique atmosphere of Heidi Breyer's project and achieve depths of emotional experiences.\n\nThe releasing of ""Beyond the Turning"" is undoubtedly a bright event of this year. Heidi Breyer continues to create and each listener is able to reach the harmonious and creative state of his soul and mind listening to her astonishing and vibrant new album.\n\nListen to the ""Beyond the Turning"" and sense what the music of the new epoch is..."
"6844","5","","B00949Y47I","0378d42d2af1f922ba0963cc1cf68c26YZYF","Heidi Breyer unleashes a tour-de-force of musicality that leaves strong and vivid impressions long after the last note plays.\n\nThe sensitive pianist really ups the ante on this offering with a stellar lineup of top-notch musicians that makes the compositions come alive with passion. The CD starts off with a tender duet between Breyer's comforting keys and David Cullen's searing electric guitar tones.\n\nFrom there, the album provides a steady flow of pensive emotion sustained by intricate solo, duo, and trio performances. Breyer's collaborators include Cullen on acoustic guitar, Charlie Bisharat on violin, Eugene Friesen on cello, Jill Haley on English horn, Samite on vocals, flutes, and adungu (a nine-string African harp), Premik Russell-Tubbs on lyricon and saxophone, Bob Colwell on accordion, Marc Enfroy on string group coordination, Max MacFarland and Michael Manring on bass, Steve Holley on drums, and Jeff Haynes on percussion.\n\nIn coordinating all of this musical chemistry, Breyer has created a unique album of exotic sounds and deep personal insight whose appeal will reach far and wide beyond just fans of piano music."
"6845","5","3","B00949Y47I","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","This new release by Heidi Breyer is one I've been looking forward to since I reviewed her previous CD in Awareness Magazine back in April of 2011. As outstanding as that one was, her latest recording takes it to the next level. The album was produced at Synchrosonic Productions by Grammy winner Corin Nelsen. While Heidi's music may generally fall into the acoustic new age category, there are elements of classical, jazz, and folk, as well as some unexpected ones.\n\nInterestingly, the album begins with ""Farewell,"" a bittersweet composition that Heidi refers to as ""a valediction to things passed."" The piece which begins as a plaintive piano solo, evolves to include one of those ""unexpected elements"" alluded to earlier. In my mind I could imagine a scenario where jazz virtuoso Keith Jarrett is alone in his studio playing a solo piano ballad, when Carlos Santana slips in through the back door, plugs in, and begins to join in with his signature soaring lead guitar. However, in this case the Grammy-winning guitarist was David Cullen, and the pianist, of course, Heidi Breyer.\n\nThe musical interaction continues on the second track, this time between Heidi's eloquent grand piano and three-time Grammy winner, cellist Eugene Friesen, who is well known as a member of The Paul Winter Consort. While Heidi's influences range from the classical masters such as Bach and Chopin to the earthy folk music of Janis Ian, she pays a heartfelt tribute to her favorite jazz pianist, Bill Evans, on a spacious solo composition called ""My Peace Piece. The album is mostly instrumental, yet Heidi's lovely vocals also grace the recording.\n\nWhile solo piano ""passages"" are interspersed throughout the album, further creative collaborations ensue on an evocative and soulful composition entitled ""Moondancing,"" which features former Pat Metheney Group percussionist Jeff Haynes, and Premik Russell-Tubbs on sax. On the title track, Heidi is joined by the always-tasteful English horn accompaniment of Jill Haley. Insight into the inspiration for the title ""Beyond The Turning"" can be found in Heidi's reflection that ""the concept of the road is so important, precisely because you don't know what lies beyond the turning, and the only way to find out is to travel it."""

There is an real 90's vibe to the track, but it is obviously modernized in all the right ways.  The vocals are creamy good, dwelling in that ambiguous nature with which Active Child stakes their claim as well (What is feminine?  What is masculine?).  This is a great introduction to a band I can't wait to hear more from.

Musically, he was one of the most influential entertainers of all time. But after the 80's and early 90's, Michael was losing his seat from the throne, and in 2009, he passed away. But he had some of the most brilliant songs during his peak of his success, and that will never be taken away from what he left behind. When the pressure was on to follow-up the mammoth success of Thriller, Bad didn't have the sales success in the long run, but Michael still had the chart success and some of the most timeless songs of his career, in fact more timeless than even Thriller, Off The Wall, or what he had with his brothers in the Jackson 5. Man In The Mirror remains one of Michael's most riveting ballad of the 80's, that still has as much serious heart reflecting on the negative world around us, and how differences can be made for a better life for everyone. It still is one of Michael Jackson's deepest ballads that is worth listening to each and every time. If you have never even heard a Michael Jackson song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: B+"

Sorry showcases itself as a single that has heavy R&B influence. Many have compared it to a melody that is similar to Genuwine's 2001 hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Differences/dp/B00136NXNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Differences</a>, as well as to Ciara's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Promise-Main-Version/dp/B0013FYKQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Promise (Main Version)</a>. And I definitely can see the similarity to Differences. What I will say is that Ciara has shown vocal growth in this song, as well as her vulnerability as an artist and a woman. The song has depth and lyrics all estranged lovers can in fact relate to, and was definitely what Ciara fans have been asking for."

Sadly, the lack of heart in her Basic Insinct record, hurt her in her drive and as well as her songs. She wasn't able to make it with her Fantasy Ride record either, and it failed to deliver. Now, she is trying it again with her song Sorry, from her upcoming album One Woman Army. Sadly, the song isn't as driven as she could've made it with her earlier songs. I really didn't find sorry to be so strong. It lacked in making it all the way home in voice. I really think Ciara needs to find a better tune when One Woman Army comes out. If more songs are going to be poorly made, than Ciara will lose her element. Hopefully, the next single from her upcoming record could be more than Sorry.\n\nSong: C-"

Not just for having a catchy beat and lyrics that are actually intelligible and (fairly) clean, but for having an incredibly inspiring message as well.  It's not just a good song, but a powerful anthem toward being the best you can be and following your dreams.  And while that may seem like a saccharine message in our day and age, it's still a meaningful one, and one we need to remember.\n\nThis song makes me want to check out more of The Script's work... and perhaps give more of the work of will.i.am a shot.

The song has good energy, but the band is over-singing, and they are out of tune in several places.  The recording quality is odd; it sounds a bit like it was recorded in a hollow tunnel by a band that included screaming out the lyrics  (look at the cover!) and pounding on the drums.  Note: this is a new band, working out their sound.  Overall, it's okay, but I'd like to hear them in a couple of years when they've had a chance to grow.  I'm glad I got it on a free promotion.

These are played by the Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando, and I have become a fan of his because of this Beethoven set. I've read that he does the same thing that Glenn Gould did when he played: i.e. he hums. You can barely hear it on these recordings though, in case you were wondering. These were all recorded in Hungary back in the late '80's to the early '90's, when the collapse of the Iron Curtain brought freedom to Eastern Europe. The recordings are simple and not gussied up in any fancy kind of way. Because of this the lighter and shorter sonatas tend to come out better, while the bigger and heavier sonatas are still good but not great. This set will not diminish in the mind's eye the 2 greatest Beethoven pianists ever, Schnabel and Kempff, but it is still a must own for lovely-lovely-Ludwig-Van fanatics. Not to be missed.-------------------PEACE"
"7624","5","","B00A1BC3B2","bf6338a70a154d69217462cf75871768D0Z3","I recently discovered Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas while browsing through the digital music section at Amazon.com. When I saw this MP3 albums amazingly low price of $6.99 for the entire collection of 32 Beethoven piano sonatas, I immediately purchased it. I am very glad I did.\n\nJen Jand&oacute; is a Hungarian concert pianist who has recorded for the Naxos classical music label for over twenty years. He is the featured soloist on Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas, and his performances of these masterworks are uniformly excellent. Jand&oacute; plays in a highly polished, artistic, and yet straightforward manner that conveys Beethovens full range of emotions very effectively, but without any unnecessary musical flourishes. He is very easy and enjoyable to listen to. I don't think he is in quite the same exalted company as elite concert pianists like Murray Perahia, Vladimir Ashkenazy, or Martha Argerich, (to name but a few), but Jand&oacute; acquits himself very well indeed in each note of every Beethoven piano sonata he plays.\n\nI think Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas by Jen Jand&oacute; is an excellent way to acquire a complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas at a very affordable price. While perhaps not the very top choice for these works, it is certainly a clear winner, and one of my new favorites. Highly recommended. (4 Stars ^ 5)"

But when she passed away in 2012, the entertainment industry lost one of its most beautiful treasures at the soul. When she passed on right before the Grammy Awards, it hit the world like a sledgehammer at the soul of the heart. I definitely know Whitney had never forgot how people treated her more like she personally was a mistake, and not a soulful and simplistic songstress. When Whitney passed on in 2012, right before Sparkle was released to the public, it felt like the world lost its voice. Arista chose to release a posthumous hits album to celebrate Whitney's legacy, and one of her last songs, I Look To You was recorded as a duet with R. Kelly. The newer version of I Look To You didn't even ignite with R. Kelly, whom wrote the song for Whitney over a decade earlier, but it didn't get to Whitney, until she decided to get back in the music industry, after she was mocked by the populace as the ""Crack Is Whack"" girl. When the song originally came out in 2009 from Whitney alone for her final album, it was beautiful and sincere at the soul, because the world was mourning the death of Michael Jackson, and it was truly beautiful beyond words. But posthumously with R. Kelly, it sincerely was no where near the ""Unforgettable"" intimacy in posthumous duets. It isn't a bad download for new Whitney fans and die hard fans of ""The Voice."" But new fans and others, should just listen to her final album in 2009, I Look To You, and then judge for themselves.\n\nSong: C+"

I heard her voice and it was as though time stopped. For the first time, I really heard the simplicity of her new voice. Gone were those high notes and fancy vocal gymnastics of her early days. Instead, there was a new voice of someone who had gone through an experience and was still struggling to survive it. I liked her new voice and really wish that her audience would have allowed her to explore it more instead of criticizing her for not sounding like she did in the early years. As I continued to drive, I noticed water streaming down my cheeks as I thought about the prophetic nature of the song for her life and vocal treasure we lost. This version of the song is simply beautiful."

I like it but I would give it a sample listen if you aren't sure because John Lennon's ethereal style isn't for everyone. There is no doubt that John Lennon's voice was a unique gift to humanity. When you hear it, you rarely have to guess who the possible vocalist is (with the exception of the vocals of John's son Julian who has his facial structure). Just like John's tendency to complexity in vocals in the Beatles so to here is John being John. There's no doubt about that."
"7725","5","","B0042UBYZO","4e05fd5639f7f06b382b24d4ab3f237dR5D5","bwaaowww...that's my onomatopoeia for the guitar sound that opens #9 Dream. It sounds like an instantaneous sunrise, like bwaaowww! and the sun is up. The guitarist is Jesse Ed Davis and he is playing the sweetest wah pedal tone ever. Listening to this song is like floating on a cloud. Very much of its time, breezy mid-70s production with a heavy layer of smoothness, kind of like 10CC's 'I'm Not in Love' or The Hollies 'Air that I Breathe'.\n\nNicky Hopkins on keyboards and John's pal Klaus Voormann on bass. I always feel a little sadness about John when I hear his music, but then I know he doesn't want people hanging their heads - keep yer chin up, world! I never knew that John had used the string arrangement already, on Nilsson's version of Many Rivers to Cross. It's fun to hear it on a different song. Once in a rare while I obsess over the tinniness of the reverb used on John's voice, but it's pretty well buried under the heavy string gravy...man it's thick. But so ultra-creamy. And, obviously, dreamy.\n\nAh! bwakawa pouss, pouss"
"7727","5","","B0042UBYZO","25321f920402f3a4fe69af8d28f56493NC3T","My review title is a no doubt barely adequate attempt to transcribe John's ""speaking in tongues"" signing on the chorus of this song. To me, this song is a distant cousin of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" in that it evokes a memory from childhood of discovering something both magical and profoundly emotional. They symphony playing along with John sounds way more soulful than anything ELO ever managed. ""#9 Dream"" is one of those moments where John's artsy side yields something absolutely lovely, as opposed to, say, his artsy side yielding something like ""Two Virgins"". Maybe ""ama bakawa pussy pussy"" was John having a prophetic vision of Pussy Riot and cheering them on?"

I'll admit he doesn't have the best flow of the group or even the best rhymes, but there's something about his voice that is commanding. On this album, he brings that commanding force and rhymes really well on some songs, does good then loses his momentum, or just kind of talks in rhyme. The beats are off the hook, the music does have alot of soul in it, but I can't give this 5 stars because Masta Killa made a really solid effort but it wasn't something that I'll be spinning again anytime soon. The shout-outs to all his influeneces and his tribute to Ol Dirty, that was a really cool way to end things I gotta say. People who say this is not worth your time and bad, I wouldn't go that far. If you like Wu-Tang or even like Masta Killa, pick this up and you'll probably enjoy it. Just know it's not somethin that's gonna blow your mind or anything. Recommended,"

It has a laid back atmosphere that decently complements Masta Killa's delivery but the majority of the end is either talking or skits. The production is rather all over the place as some have that Wu-Tang trademark sound while others go on a West Coast synthesized appeal. Masta Killa performs decently with his slow delivery, deep lyrics, and somewhat average flow but the lack of solid hooks, too many skit-time, and change in production kills it. Add his weak attempt to sound like ODB (he is paying homage) and you get annoyed. This is more of a backpack album, beware."

Enough quality songs to maintain 5 stars, some of the dups are great songs.\n\nFearless by Our Lost Infantry. Identifiable up front lead vocal over busy band. Nice Alt. song w/peaking vocals & strong sound. Very nice 5 minutes although repeating same line to end gets old fast.\n\nHome by Lights & Motion. Opening light weight bells & keyboard, sounding little seasonal (Christmas) grows in volume & content as the song progresses. Melds into nice instrumental. Like it.\n\nStorms by Accents. Lone pleasant male vocal over acoustic guitar. Singer song writer number with some minor backing. Very nice.\n\nColors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor. Indie Pop Instrumentation, Post Rock Atmospherics per their record label. And they are correct, ambitious almost grand sound that cruises along. Enjoyable well produced, very nice.\n\nThe Lines Above Our Heads, Again For The Win. Slow, simple build w/steady band and great lead vocal. Song opens out to quality Indie number, controlled & deliberate. Like it, very nice.\n\nUltrapop by Ethienne. Mild distorted fuzz keyboard sound, simple pop song, electro vocal over keyboards, chorus & beat. Okay.\n\nMiles by Keystone Kids. Electronic pop (stolen from record label web site) is not a bad description. Nothing special indie/pop, you will like it.\n\nTrack 8 is Granville by The Sky Life. Male lead singer slowly keeping up with acoustic backing. Deliberate vocals that I did not care enough about to listen to. Slow s/sw number you will love it.\n\nSleep by The Cast Before The Break. Cool mildly threatening opening on quality ambient/indie rock song. Layered punching sounds behind superior male vocal. Very nice 6 minutes including frantic center & end. Love it.\n\nRed Lightning Child/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery. Another instrumental track. Strong busy track, no vocals but pounding collection of band parts that keeps your attention. Never breaks out into hard rock (to me) but easily rides the edge for the whole wave. Very nice, like it.\n\nA Different Heav'n by The Dandelion War. Lavish Atmospherics still a valid description, choral vocal over subdued not much. Little more sound starts half way through the song. You may love it.\n\nLet Us In! (Come On) by The Lions Rampant. Great garage rock sound, energy and uninhibited sound. Nothing fancy kinda punk meets The Kinks feel. Love it.\n\nHomage To Excess by Cari Clara. Straining male vocal over acoustic guitar, kinda emotional number, not for me. You may love it.\n\nLast track, Speaking For Everyone (Version II-Piano) by Athletics. Mellow piano opening (no really?) lone male vocal unwinding & growing with the song. Nice.\n\nDeep Elm included some duplicate tracks from Postrockology released couple of days ago on this sampler. All sound great as does this sampler & it's all free pointless to complain. Mostly thoughtful, smart, well produced ambient & indie songs. Nothing heavy, very nice.\nThe duplicate songs are: Home by Lights & Motion, Colors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor, Sleep by The Cast Before The Break and Red Lightning Child/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery.\nDownload & delete, more good stuff from Deep Elm."
"7842","5","3","B00AFXD08Q","8927944f9170620db16f51af1f812a64OSYP","Timothy Crane's ""Pianoforte"" is a set that jumps out at you.  I think I came to love the expressiveness of piano via the pop music of Laura Nyro.  The track that blows me away totally is the less-than-two-minute ""Awaken the Dawn"" with its piano elegant and celebratory and the orchestration that bolsters the sound.  From there, the CD opens into a wide emotional panorama with Crane's piano always evoking emotion such as on ""Clear Creek"" that moves briskly and then gets pensive.  ""Untouched"" has a classical feel.  ""Soli Deo Gloria"" is lush and lovely & makes me want to write a lyric and have it sung by Josh Groban.  ""Archetype"" starts with a strong orchestral introduction before Crane's piano takes over announcing triumphal jubilation.  The set closes with the musical reflection ""Stratford Road.""  Timothy Crane's music is so lovely that I hope it finds the wide audience it deserves.  For now, it's one of my favorites.  Enjoy!"
"7843","5","5","B00AFXD08Q","0378d42d2af1f922ba0963cc1cf68c26YZYF","Timothy Cranes third album is a nice collection of classy piano tunes that provide a pleasant listening experience.\n\nWhile Crane is an accomplished and versatile performer, he has chosen to make his elegant compositions the focus of this record. The melodies and chord progressions are graceful and tasteful, brought to vivid life by Cranes masterful piano technique, as well as his synthesized orchestration and some accompaniment by Rick Henley on acoustic guitar. At times, both Cranes compositions and performances remind me a little bit of Bruce Hornsby.\n\nThis is a fine CD that is a delight to listen to from beginning to end."
"7844","5","","B00AFXD08Q","889e6950d11de4656e04e9f09f9f9b5d20QH","The moments of the day are passing very quickly\nBut all of them together form the life\n\nThis music is very bright. It has an inner power and optimism which stir the soul from the first moments. Sometimes quick, sometimes slow it flows as moments of your life with its joys and sorrows pass before your eyes. And you can see all your life in perspective.\n\nThe piano music of Timothy Crane full of dramatic effect as it is a soundtrack to exciting movie. Exquisite orchestrations are beautifully added to the inspiring music of the artist.\n\nAll these features of Timothy Crane's music are important. But maybe the most significant feature of his music is the composer is always in the moment, he creates in the present time and he is completely immersed in his music.\n\nI can compare the music of ""Pianoforte"" with a colorful butterfly which flutters from one beautiful flower to another.\n\nWhen the music ends one wants to exclaim: ""Why this happened so fast!"" because ""Pianoforte"" belongs to that sort of music which you undoubtedly want to listen to time and again.\n\nThe music of the newest album of Timothy Crane dies down but its charm remains with you."
"7845","5","2","B00AFXD08Q","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Pianoforte"" is Timothy Crane's third release, following ""Dragonfly"" (2010) and ""The Other Life I Dream"" (2004). A lifelong musician who started out in a rock band, Crane calls his music ""instrumental pop"" and enjoys including an assortment of musical styles in each collection. This group of twelve original pieces features the piano front and center and includes acoustic guitar by Rick Henley and orchestration created by Crane and Jason Rowsell. Like his previous albums, ""Pianoforte"" was produced on a shoestring budget by independent musicians ""who simply want to create and play music - even if it means recording on the weekends in a basement."" Thanks to technology and Crane's experience, this does NOT sound like music recorded in a basement or garage. Styles range from quiet and reflective to more upbeat and energetic, making this a really good album for driving, working, or just kicking back and getting lost in.\n\n""Pianoforte"" begins with ""What Will I Be?,"" a piece that begins quietly with oboe and piano, suggesting a daydream - perhaps a young child staring out a window, lost in thought. As it evolves, the piece becomes fuller and more orchestrated, sounding more like a film soundtrack. ""Awaken the Dawn"" is quite different with an effervescent piano flourish for starters and a big, powerful orchestra keeping the piece dancing and spinning throughout. ""Clear Creek"" goes in yet another direction with piano and acoustic guitar (with background orchestration) painting a scene of peaceful respite and reflection. ""Untouched"" reminds me of the wonder of discovering places that have been ""untouched"" by civilization - wilderness areas, mountain vistas, remote beaches, etc. Piano, oboe, and orchestra give this piece a range from playful to awe-inspiring.  ""Disappearing Moon"" includes a bold piano part, mandolin (I think!), and full orchestra. The strummed instrument gives the piece a mysterious touch that I really like. ""Red Line"" is a piece Crane often plays in concert but that had not yet been recorded. One of the faster and bigger pieces, I would imagine that this is a real crowd pleaser live! ""Soli Dio Gloria"" is by far the longest track at just over five minutes, and feels emotional and personal, like telling about very moving chapter from ones life or giving heartfelt advice to someone close who is hurting - my favorite on this album. ""Archetype"" is very cinematic and visual with a big sweep and an infectious energy. I really like this one, too! ""Stratford Road"" brings the album to a peaceful and dreamy close with a piece that evokes nostalgia and longing - also a beauty!\n\nEven though this CD is relatively short at 33 minutes, these pieces are all full and complete. Anything more could spoil the mood. Recommended!"
"7846","5","","B00AFXD08Q","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","Tim's music is something he characterizes as ""instrumental pop,"" which reflects influences from new age, rock, popular, and even classical music. Right from the opening track, a blend of distinctive melody and impressive technique is evident. Although the track, entitled ""What Will I Be,"" is barely over 2 minutes long, it feels like a complete composition and exhibits a surprising dynamic range in its brief lifespan. In fact, all but one song out of twelve are under 3:15 in length. This brings the total time of the CD to around 33 minutes - relatively short for a CD, but like a buffet of extremely rich food, small portions are just right. By the end you certainly feel like you've had a very full listening experience, given the intricacy and diversity of Tim's music. Although the piano is the centerpiece of the album, lush orchestration tastefully compliments the compositions. Synthesizers and samplers add the sound of strings and woodwinds, while the acoustic guitar of Rick Henley provides accompaniment on some songs.\n\nNeo-classical and rock influences combine on ""Awaken The Dawn,"" in a virtuoso high velocity piece that brought to mind the keyboard wizardry of progressive rockers like Rick Wakeman of Yes, and Keith Emerson from Emerson Lake and Palmer. A nice contrast to this style is a tune called ""Hopefaith,"" which showcases the more gentle side of Tim's playing, yet also exhibits his dynamic range within the boundaries of a song. I was impressed with Tim's abilities as a composer and arranger, as well as with how much detail and complexity he was able to imbue in some of his relatively compact compositions. A song entitled ""Hide And Seek"" is built on a simple descending motif, providing a platform for lavish orchestration to add to the cinematic air. I appreciated that Tim chose to end the album with one of his most sensitive compositions, ""Stratford Road."" This was the perfect one to provide closure after a CD's worth of intricate, and often intense piano virtuosity. This piece had a pleasant pastoral quality that I found emotionally evocative. In general, the music on this album lends itself more to active listening, than background ambience. Timothy Crane has crafted a spirited mlange of diverse ingredients and influences in the music of ""Pianoforte."""

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

What i am going to do is say how awesome he sounds on Now What?!  The lyrics are great throughout, he sounds like he's having a lot of fun. I really dig him as a lyricist, sometimes funny at times ominous at times bizarre Mr Gillan shines throughout this record that i think is a masterpiece and one of Purple's best.  The rest of the band are merely stunning. Don Airey has really captured Jon Lords epic Organ sound so essential to DP.  The rest of the guys are just fantastic, Roger Glover is one of Rock's best bass players.  AS far as the songs go, there is not one single throwaway on this record, even the bonus track ""It'll be Me"" is a cool tune that holds up to repeated listens.  ""Vincent Price"" is over the Top and so cool i'm almost surprised these guys came up with it at this stage of their career.  The whole record is a real feast for lovers of 70's music.  Out of all the bands/artsits that came out of the 60's and 70's that have made records late in their careers including, YES, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, McCartney etc. etc. Deep Purple's What Now?! tops them all.  It really is that good.  Bob Ezrin also did he a great job.  The record sounds amazing, i've got in on vinyl and it's a beautiful gatefold with great band photos.  Highly recommended!"

They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Big-Box-Bach-Orchestral-Music/dp/B00KS0ASOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Big Box :: Bach Orchestral Music</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Handel-Oratorio-Box/dp/B00KICWEN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Handel Oratorio Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Big Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the first of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bigger-Beethoven-Box/dp/B01BHELQD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bigger Beethoven Box</a>, which I have previously reviewed), and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including piano sonatas, cello sonatas, string quartets, three of his nine symphonies, incidental music for The Creatures of Prometheus and Egmont, as well as piano variations, minuets, sonatinas, overtures, rondos, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Big Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I do have two minor reservations about it:\n\n1. There are no piano trios on ""Big Beethoven Box."" Some of my favorite Beethoven chamber music masterpieces  especially his Archduke and Ghost trios  belong to this sub-genre, and I think the fact that none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.\n\n2. The albums engineering does not quite rise to the level of the best Big Box albums  especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.  There are also a few technical glitches to the album that require manual editing of individual tracks metadata. (See reviewer Upstate Listeners excellent review for tips on how to fix these problems.)\n\nDespite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Highly recommended.  (4 Stars ^ 5)"

I love that moment at 3:03, her voice rips the air as she screams out Rape, murder!, and Mick (I presume) lets out a woo! Keith's opening guitar riff is classic.

I became a fan of him with the release of the previous album, 2011's ""Underneath the Pine"".\n\n""Anything In Return"" (13 tracks; 52 min.) starts off with an immediately inviting pick-me-up ""Harm In Change"" and an equally charming ""Say That"", both of which signal a continuation towards the more dance-oriented songs found on ""Underneath the Pine"" and also the ""Freaking Out"" EP. But then things slow down and Bundick turns more melancholic and reflective on tracks like ""So Many Details"" and ""Cola"". In fact, the album stays mostly in that same mid-tempo groove, and somehow it works quite nicely. ""Never Matter"" towards the end of the album is one last song in which the dance-along factor is increased again. In all, I am enjoying this album quite a bit. Perfect for these summer days!\n\nLast weekend at the FYF in Los Angeles, Toro Y Moi (live a full band, not just Bundick) put on a fantastic 50 min. set before a wildly enthusiastic (and massive) crowd. Bundick & Co. brought a great mix of old and new songs, featuring about 4 or 5 songs from this album (including ""Say That"", ""Rose Quartz"", and ""Never Matter""). I must say that live these songs sounded more massive than anything you hear on the album, and their set was one of the festival's highlights for me, without a doubt, I enjoyed it a ton! Meanwhile ""Anything In Return"" is highly recommended!"

"8332","5","","B00B0M2DH0","7bde9f42f454ec55543fc987fbcc97c426Z0","This would turn out to be an unusual review for me to do, I would really have to search my soul to feel this album around me and allow it to touch me in the same way as they events that have conspired over the years to touch musician Isadar to bring forth a real hard hitting, emotional roller coaster of the release RED.\nRed is a true bittersweet relationship tester, Broken Valentine I almost felt was not only dark but also chaotic. Isadar as a unique quality to enable him to almost read you a story through his style of playing, you are literally travelling through the heart and mind with the musician and in Broken Valentine, through the journey perhaps of a dysfunctional relationship.\nThe title track is placed at two and Red seems to once more take you through this ever changing and emotive journey of love good or bad, its a piece that I found almost representative of being able to watch your life and love back in the wonderful luxury of hindsight and smart at the bad decisions and smile at the fond memories, love is indeed red and as close to anger in emotions as indeed is the colour.\nThe man who broke my heart was written about Isadars relationship problems with his father, as a listener and reviewer I found this piece almost cried out to me at such a deep level and you could almost hear the child crying alone in a dark corner of his bedroom with that helpless feeling of dejection and let down hanging over your head, this is a deeply felt composition, but where we see the music being the healer.\nThe Stairwell I can honestly say is the track I felt the most moved by, the beginning of this track could easily be a soundtrack for a blockbusting suspense movie, it has that emotive quality about it and indeed while listening to this piece and the next one I was almost moved to tears myself.\nWho could have imagined what occurred in or on the stairwell and the caressing of the keys by Isadar on this piece almost imprints memories into the very walls of this place, from the stairwell and almost towards the end of this piece I could sense a light starting to appear from the darkness, perhaps a chink of brightness from a distant window close to the Stairwell?\nLetting Go I found a difficult track personally for me, as one who has just come out of a thirty eight year relationship it is always hard to let go, especially of those like my late wife who has passed over. Part of the healing process is to eventually let go, but not just of the physical relationship but of all the regrets and guilt. Here this track really hits the nail right on the head, it deals with the very essence of the letting go process, it reflects the turbulence of emotions that seems to echo in the hard playing within this piece, as Isadar plays forcefully you can almost hear him working through this very process and of course the end result is what we should always have freedom, this piece is the perfect musical representation of the letting go process, as Isadar says about the album, its bittersweet.\nEn Face Du Miroir (Facing The mirror) This a composition of hope and renewal, but most of all courage, here Isadars style seems to be more reflective on his journey, the feeling from the chords and structure is almost like a person has come through a great time of struggle and at this point is literally looking down into his own soul for a time of reflection, the journey seems to be endless and the style here seems to reflect that and in the moment when love and hate collide there is always our passion that will set us free.\nBlood Thicker Than Water, this is the ultimate track to end such an album with, from the journey of love and emotions, here Isadar stars with a dark reflective style, but that soon changes to a more upbeat conflict and resolution feel, we can truly sense here that some sort of reconciliation has been found and from that the melody it gives us a brilliant ending to the project, we can also truly feel that here now is a person who has really found his place in life and is now finding the support he always truly wanted.  This was actually my favourite track from the album.\nRed is a very powerful concept, its a rare album that actually does address the bittersweet emotions of love and hate as they crash together on the rocks of life, simply put if you are serious about your music and are very particular of what you play, then you really need to get a cop of RED by ISADAR."
"8333","5","","B00B0M2DH0","0378d42d2af1f922ba0963cc1cf68c26YZYF","Although Isadar's latest solo piano album was timed to release around Valentine's Day because of its love-inspired themes, the music is wide-ranging and versatile enough to be enjoyed all year long.\n\nThe real love that comes through on the CD is that which Isadar clearly has for music and the piano, as evidenced by his brilliant and quirky songwriting and passionate performances. Some of the tunes are subtle and intimate, and others are grand and sweeping, but they are all clever and original thanks to Isadar's convention-defying compositions. Sometimes you think you know where the music's leading you, and then all of a sudden it comes at you out of left field, making it lively and engaging.\n\nThis writing style keeps Isadar's fingers on their toes, so to speak. Isadar's mastery of his craft is apparent in the seemingly effortless ease with which he can go from light to dark and from understated to emphatic. His phrasing and chord progressions are also smart and snappy.\n\nThis is a rewarding experience for those who are willing to accompany Isadar on his musical journey of love."
"8334","5","","B00B0M2DH0","8927944f9170620db16f51af1f812a64OSYP","This musician is on a roll, releasing three amazing CDs in close proximity.  I hope the sales follow the stunning music.  ""Broken Valentine"" opens the set with Isadar's piano vibrant, joyful, with a wistful touch, like a failed love affair that energizes you to go and love some more.  The title track ""Red"" has a brisk and vibrant piano that follows several themes.  ""The Man Who Broke My Heart"" may be my favorite track with its melody expansive, perhaps with touches of anger tempering the joys of the heart.  ""Letting Go"" hits a more somber reflective tone on the longest track on the CD before soaring into orbit about two minutes into the song with Isadar vibrant runs on the piano.  ""En Face Du Miroir (Facing the Mirror)"" has a slower pace that matches the often melancholy melody.  The set concludes with the amazingly confident ""Blood...Thicker Than Water"" that to me speaks of the joys of family relationship, strong despite its ups and downs and periodic conflicts.  ""Red"" is vibrant piano, incredibly inventive and fresh.  Enjoy!"
"8335","5","","B00B0M2DH0","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Red"" is pianist/composer Isadar's genre-defying tenth solo piano album and seventeenth independent release from the past twenty years. It is also the third installment in a trilogy of solo piano albums released in the past year - ""Reconstructed,"" a Will Ackerman-produced anthology of some of Isadar's best piano pieces; ""O Christmas,"" Isadar's second piano Christmas album; and now ""Red,"" a bittersweet love-themed album that took seven years to produce and that consists of the first new original solo piano material Isadar has released in more than ten years. I have been reviewing and thoroughly enjoying Isadar's releases since his second piano album, 1999's ""Active Imagination,"" which still stands as one of my favorite recordings. Even though I have been a big fan for many years, I was still blown away by Isadar's live performance in my house concert series in July 2010. The man has magic fingers and an extraordinary piano touch that are perfectly suited to express his imaginative, distinctive, and emotionally powerful music. Isadar is also a singer/songwriter and an electronic musician who creates the music videos for much of his music, dramatizing the stories that inspired the songs. I will always be partial to Isadar's piano albums because his voice and vision are unique, incorporating jazz, new age, pop, and classical stylings into a musical language all his own.\n\n""Red"" opens with ""Broken Valentine,"" a free-flowing expression of heartbreak and the broad range of emotions that go with it, alternating between grief and confusion then shifting to perhaps anger and resignation - a great beginning. The title track conveys the freedom of an improvisation while weaving together a variety of upbeat themes. ""The Man Who Broke My Heart"" is energetic and in constant swirling motion - also very free and from deep within. ""The Stairwell"" is darker and much more mysterious, overflowing with Isadar's intriguing accented rhythms and picturesque compositional style. My favorite track is the almost nine-minute ""Letting Go,"" a piece that intertwines a series of musical vignettes into a powerful, colorful musical collage. I love the way Isadar seamlessly goes from flowing and smooth to a bouncy jazz style to high drama without missing a beat. Great stuff! ""En Face Du Miroir (Facing the Mirror)"" is much lighter, with fingers dancing nimbly around the piano keyboard. The album closes with ""Blood ... Thicker Than Water,"" again a combination of changing themes that could well be a musical family portrait - different personalities working separately and as a unit, bound together by the unseen ties that keep families together through thick and thin.\n\nIsadar has created another piano masterpiece that should be more widely heard than his previous releases due to the success of ""Reconstructed."" I hope so, anyway! Very highly recommended!"
"8336","5","","B00B0M2DH0","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","If you've heard Isadar's previous music and think you are familiar with his style, as the saying goes, ""you ain't heard nothing yet."" While still a solo piano recording, Red opens the door to a whole new dimension of Isadar's keyboard talent and vision. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Red is the infusion of high-energy jazz and neo-classical elements into Isadar's generally impressionistic new age style. On Red, Isadar steps out and charts a bold new direction for his music.\n\nInterestingly, Red is being released around Valentines Day, and opens with a track entitled ""Broken Valentine."" This piece is a perfect example of the creative freedom Isadar has chosen to express on this album. As I listened to the lovely emotionally moving melody, I assumed that the entire composition would unfold along similar lines. So I had a bit of a surprise after about a minute when the piece suddenly took off in a decidedly jazzier direction, with the feel of a hang glider pilot leaping off a cliff and taking to the wind. At this point, I experienced a side of Isadar's playing that I hadn't heard before quite like this. It was powerful, passionate, and spirited, bringing to mind jazz greats Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. Yet even in the midst of this intense forward motion, Isadar makes good use of dynamics and modulates the tempo and movement using an occasional pregnant pause as a prelude to shifting musical gears.\n\nThe title song does not have quite the same dramatic ratio of yin to yang as the first track, but does shift freely between a flowing melody and a bouncy rhythmic motif within the composition. ""The Man Who Broke My Heart"" is a lush evocative piece that highlights Isadar's ability to dig deep into emotional terrain with impeccable style and grace. Likewise on ""The Stairwell,"" which is a beautifully sensitive piece that unlike some of the earlier songs has a higher degree of thematic consistency throughout, although there are some crescendos that are quite powerful within the context of the song's subtlety. ""Letting Go"" marks a return to Isadar's pattern of contrasting diverse elements within the framework of a single composition. Starting out in a more wistful and melancholy air, it evolves, within its nine-minute length, into a markedly different space that actually had my head nodding and my toe tapping along with it.\n\nRed is a masterful recording that encompasses stunning technique, imaginative composition, and the willingness to take a risk in following the pied piper of one's muse, wherever it may lead. I have every reason to believe that listeners will happily get in line behind him on this exciting musical adventure."

Vesta is in excellent form, vocally, on this CD and most of the songs are truly emotional and heartfelt. In a certain way, this CD compares very much favorably to her 1998-issued CD ""Relationships"" in the sense that you hear an older, wiser and more mature Vesta singing about life's ups and downs and also about romantic relationships. Had Vesta lived to be able to see this CD released and had she been able to promote it via live performances it would probably have helped to rejuvenate her career as most of the songs would have fit perfectly onto the playlists of Smooth Jazz and Urban Adult Contemporary stations. In any event, it is all too obvious that Vesta literally poured her heart, soul and spirit into the making of this CD and it remains a fitting tribute to one of the best but most underrated R&B Divas of our time.

But I somehow missed that a few months later, ""Seven"" her posthumous album was finally released. Thanks to a casual email exchange with a friend, I was finally brought up to speed.\n\nIt is far too early for me to truly assess how I feel about ""Seven"" since I can sometimes take awhile to truly appreciate a new album. How I wish most albums were instant no-brainers like the Album(s) of the Year, ""The 20/20 Experience Pts. 1 & 2). I will say, the last few songs on ""Seven"" drew my intention more than the first half.\n\nBut, I rate it 4 stars because I trust that this final work by Vesta will soon find a place in my heart.\n\nShe looks great on the album. A few tracks do seem to have slight sound glitches despite being informed that the indie label remastered the album again in July.......so I am thinking I just bought one of the more recent copies since it is November."

I recently acquired The Bach Guild's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com, and I liked it so much I decided to add another one of the Big Box albums to my digital music collection. This time I chose the Big Mozart Box. It turned out to be an inspired choice.\n\nBig Mozart Box features nearly 14 hours of instrumental music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all for only 99 cents. This superlative MP3 album contains an extraordinarily impressive array of music from a variety of sub-genres within the oeuvre of Mozarts music. Mozart is known to have composed over 600 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his short lifetime. Over 40 of his instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Mozart Box. They include divertimenti, serenades, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, and others. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Mozarts incredibly inventive musical genius.\n\nThese are all superb performances from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in every performance. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Mozart infused into his music. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings (a few of them are monaural), the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.\n\nOf all the Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I think Big Mozart Box is clearly the best. I listen to it constantly, and I am always highly entertained by it. Most highly recommended."

At the offered price, this collection truly is AMAZING.  Do not be concerned that the renderings by the orchestras here are only on par with your local high school band, as you'll be hard pressed to discern any difference in these professional performances from those of even the most renowned orchestras. I believe your pleasure from listening to this collection will be as great as your pleasure at having acquired it for so little. A safer bet doesn't likely exist."

The song begins with an African/reggae flavor.  In this section, the percussions are very strong.  The lyrics, however, have uneven volume levels.  Additionally, they sound distant.  Although the lyrics are unintelligible, they combine with the instrumentals, and are a bit mesmerizing.  (I looked them up on line, and they were about a woman whose behavior confuses the singer.) The chorus begins the first electronic/new age section, and includes some odd sound effects. Finally, the song ends with a new age passage that is very short and that cuts off very abruptly.\n\nThe song is strange, interesting and annoying.  The best thing about this product is the pretty cover, which is a strange commentary on music, isn't it?\n\nI downloaded it as a free promotion.

It is a beautiful proclamation about waiting and trusting in the Lord, despite what we see/hear, despite our season of darkness.  It is basically infusing us with what we need in order to walk faithfully with God.  Thus, it is about *trust*, *patience*, and *endurance*, though the latter two words are not pronounced within the lyrics.  It is also about not making major, life decisions without God's input.\n\nLYRIC HIGHLIGHTS: ""In the silence, in the waiting...still, we can know you are good.""<<--[this is what made me buy this song]...""Promised Maker, promised Keeper, you finish what you begin.""...""From this darkness, you will lead us, and forever we will say, 'You're the Lord, our God.'

"8799","4","","B00BJ6C5Q6","20cab76c4daf87b36f7c57be518e2ce56ABF","In a letter, Beethoven referred to Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) as my most beloved brother. His fond reference may have more to do with the fact that Hoffmeister published his 1st Symphony and his 2nd Piano concerto rather than any affectionate sentiment. Besides running his publishing house which is still in existence today as the London firm of Peters Edition Ltd., Hoffmeister also wrote a little music. At least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works have been credited to him. Counted in in that impressive output are at least 25 flute concertos, including the 3 here.\n\nProbably written some time before 1800 and published in 1803, the C Major Concerto is listed as No. 16. Trumpets and tympani give substance to the orchestral introduction of the opening Allegro, a sharp contrast to the long fluttering entrance of the flute. Characterized by a festive tone and a broad expansive sweep, this first movement features splendid work by the soloist, especially in the final cadenza, which incorporates elements of the opening theme. Written in C Minor, the dark Adagio drops the drums and brass to achieve a tragic air. Languid and sensuous, the central section brightens into the key of E Flat with some gorgeous tonality from the solo wind before a somber ending. With the full orchestra, the final Rondo is direct and straightforward, employing a bouncy irrepressibility that not even a brief excursion into A Minor can dim.\n\nDating from 1793 if not earlier, the concerto in G Major sports a leaner sound than the first work as the strings are accompanied only by horns and oboes. A sprawling Allegro opens, noteworthy for its juxtaposition of the wide ranging symphonic passages against the more nimble, intensely lyrical work of the flute. The concluding cadenza exhibits some outstanding work by the soloist, Bruno Meier, not surprising since he wrote it, as he did all the solo cadenzas on the this recording. Composed in G Minor, the elegiac Adagio seems to unfold as a funeral march. As the music shifts into B Flat, the grief disperses, but only fleetingly before the gloom descends for the final notes. A chirping flute initiates the closing Rondo Allegretto. Darting in and out of the more structured orchestral sections, the solo wind presents a wide array of virtuosic episodes in the carefree finale of the concerto recorded as No. 22.\n\nPenned in D Major, Concerto No. 17 was likely written before the other two offerings. Buttressed by oboes and horns, the quirky Allegro starts with a formal orchestral introduction, but soon deteriorates into a startling hesitancy. Restarting with renewed vigor, the surprising timidity returns and only dissipates when the flute finally enters, bringing a resolute assurance to this clever 1st movement. Over delicately plucked strings, a gentle flute carries the ensuing Romanza: poco Adagio, one of the high points of the disc. Elastic phrasing allows the soloist to explore the subtleties of this jewel, venturing into darker regions as the music shifts into a minor keyed interlude. Using a precise, clipped attack, the jaunty Rondo Allegretto concludes the recording. Offering a bravura display of technique and rhythmic dexterity, the sprightly episodes roll by, retaining a relentlessly sunny tone.\n\nOn his 14 carat gold flute, Bruno Meier is superb. Nearly as good, the Prague Chamber Orchestra supplies sensitive and thoughtful backing while the 2013 release by Naxos is excellent, placing the solo wind front and center without shortchanging the symphonic support. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, Hoffmeister fell into obscurity upon his death. He deserves better, and this second volume of his flute concertos, all world premieres, goes a long way to correct that oversight."

In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him. He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit. Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list. With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement. Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute. Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute. And it is a virtuosic display. Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn."

Yet, while David did pass away from liver cancer in 2016, his soul and the heart of his music has still been recognized as one of the most innovative catalogs of talent to the world. His heart was in each and every song he had done, by changing looks, changing appeal, but being a smart and assertive human being. He really let the songs and the music speak for itself, and David had a huge impact by bring art rock into light for each and every album. When he released The Next Day, after a near decade long absence, he really had a lot to say, ever when his music wasn't on radio anymore. Where Are We Now?, the lead single from The Next Day is honestly one of those that sincerely brought his heart to the soul, and a sign that David matured, but his music hadn't changed at all. If you had never heard a David Bowie song, or if you're only discovering him from the impact of his death, than I sincerely recommend this song a lot.\n\nSong: B+"

With the shocking and deviating news that David Bowie had a battle with cancer, I was deeply shocked not only because he was a great innovator in art, he was a brilliant musician, whether it was through Alladian Sane, Let's Dance, or with songs like Under Pressure with Queen and China Girl. The guy was sincerely amazing. One of his last songs, showed a intimate side from his music that really showed he was still standing, after a decade-long absence from making music. Where Are We Now?, which David recorded from his 2013 album, The Last Day really showed a deepness in his music, and a brilliance in his own heart to where he was returning. The song was proof he really had, where everyone else through him off. This is a great reminder of what David showed for years in his work from fashion, art, and and sincere love for music.

He has made music for 50 years and continues to change as time has gone by, as the chameleon has has been. When I listen to his own music, I continue to think of why so many singers do not continue to grow and adapt with their sound at heart. When he had announced earlier this year that he was retiring from touring, I was not at all very shocked with his decision. He has been well advanced with his own heart, and his work continues to inspire. His song Where Are You Now?, which originally appeared on his last album The Next Day is classic Bowie at heart, and shows it by the simplicity of his own voice. He really shows it very nobly, and shows that he has not changed after all this time with his most deepest of songs. If you have loved Let's Dance or Heroes, than you'll absolutely love this song a lot. He still is here now, and will never go away.\n\nSong: B"

Reducing the recording level via MP3Gain made this track listenable by reducing the distortion caused by the excessive digital gain added during the mastering process."

They are one of my favorite bands of the era after 2000. For the most part, they maintain a flavor of classic country stemming from a time before hard rock and heavy metal oriented musicians migrated into the country genre of music. I think this occurred sometime during the '90s when heavy metal of the late '70s and '80s style fell out of vogue and heavy metal turned into some semi-melodic boring and uninspiring noise, in my opinion. This song, released in 2013 on their album 'Pioneer' was a hit for TBP. It is a wonderful song, masterfully performed by Kimberley; the back-up vocals are very sweet and harmonious. I just love it. In fact, I like the whole album. I have purchased it on virtual CD. I am an audiophile. The MP3 format does not always fill the ticket for discerning ears and a high end audio system. The MP3 download sound quality of this song is better than what I had expected, though."

Over a period spanning 16 years beginning in 1974 they recorded for three different labels, placed nearly three dozen singles on the Top 100 Singles chart and had several highly successful albums to boot. Yes, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates seemed to be everywhere during this period.\n\nHall and Oates began their recording career at Atlantic records in the early 1970's. In 1974, they had a minor hit with a tune called ""She's Gone"". Although this record was not wildly successful it was clear that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. RCA records took note and signed Hall & Oates in 1975. Their very first release for the label ""Sara Smile"" was on the charts for some 7 months and peaked at #3 in the spring of 1976. Atlantic records took note and re-released ""She's Gone"" which also became a Top Ten hit in '76.  In January 1977 RCA released the boys' third single.  ""Rich Girl"" would become the first of six #1 singles for Hall & Oates spending two weeks at the top of the charts In March of that year.  As far as I am concerned this is one of the best songs they ever recorded."

She really didn't ignite a fire in the way she did with her earlier music. That was shown in each and every song from that album, and sadly the ballads have weighed down in soul. Best Thing I Never Had is definitely a blah song, not anything to absolutely rave about. She really didn't ignite a fire from her voice into the song, and instead it felt watered down in song, especially compared to the ballads she had in her career before like Halo and Listen. Maybe she needs to find her voice again, and it will be the best thing she never had.\n\nSong: C-"

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

But sometimes, even confirmed 12 tone enthusiasts like myself enjoy a little Bellini.  Let's face it...the great masters were, well, masterful.  This dirt cheap collection has eliminated the need for me to pull out individual operas to get just the loveliest arias.  Here the all are, glittering in the sunlight, sung by some of the finest sopranos of the last 40 years.  Sumi Jo's definitive version of the aria for the Queen of the Night from Mozart's Magic Flute is worth the price of admission alone. These arias are instantly familiar to opera buffs, but the casual listener will know many of these, and it is an easy way to bring new converts in to the fold.  Listen, this music is glorious, tuneful, exquisitely sung, and a wonderful way to sip at the chalice of immortal music.  Sound is generally excellent.  The collection would be a bargain at 10x the price, and there is absolutely no reason not to pick this up at the crazy bargain price of $1.  Yes, even you folks who usually prefer Wozzeck. This music is simply stunning."

Without the variations, after about ten minutes, it sounds like an average small church choir. An good church choir would have more solos and instruments to vary the tone somewhat.

This is the fourth of The Bach Guilds Big Box albums that I have added to my digital music collection, and I think I made another inspired choice.\n\nBig Haydn Box (not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>, which I have already reviewed), features over 14 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns wonderful music. It is an extraordinarily impressive array from a variety of sub-genres within Haydns oeuvre. Haydn is known to have composed over 500 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his lifetime. By my count, 40 of his vocal and instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Box. They include divertimenti, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, masses, and an oratorio. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Haydns incredibly inventive musical genius.\n\nThese recordings from the mid-20th century feature various lesser-known but world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, choirs, and solo instrumentalists and vocalists who hail mostly from eastern Europe. All of them demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in each of their performances. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Haydn infused into his music. I have now listened to well over half of this album and I think the audio quality of these mostly older stereophonic recordings is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.\n\nOf the four Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I rank Big Haydn Box right alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;as one of the best in my digital music library. I listen to it frequently, and I am always both highly entertained and inspired by it. Most highly recommended."

Lots of little known symphony recordings from all over eastern Europe with singers, choirs and directors who quite frankly are as good or better than the better known and more expensive productions.

At the offered price, this collection truly is AMAZING.  Do not be concerned that the renderings by the orchestras here are only on par with your local high school band, as you'll be hard pressed to discern any difference in these professional performances from those of even the most renowned orchestras. I believe your pleasure from listening to this collection will be as great as your pleasure at having acquired it for so little. A safer bet doesn't likely exist."

This set is really good technically, but decent in sound quality, having been recorded back in the 50's and 60's. E. Power Biggs, Friederich Walcha, Simon Preston and others have made better Bach organ music recordings, which are all out there of course. Often those are quite expensive. However, you get the whole motherlode here for only about ten dollars! So, price wise, you can't go wrong if you are a Bachaphile. Let's just say I give it 3 stars for recording quality and performance quality, and 5 stars for all of that great music at an inexpensive price. So that rounds out to 4 stars. Just like the Vox Box set of the complete keyboard works, played by Martin Galling on harpsichord, Vox tends to get all of this stuff out at a pretty good price. And they have done it here too-----------PEACE\nBTW-Be careful. This set contains over 15 hours of music, so it might overload your cloud."

The main totem for Abundance is the mighty Buffalo, it teaches us that at all times we will always have just what we need to get through, and we have abundance. Musically this piece works superbly and was my favourite off the album; I also like the voice synthesiser segments as well, which added a certain dimensional element to the track.\nEach track from this album also related according to the material I had been given, to a specific Chakra within the energetic field or light body, so while track one signified the root or Base Chakra we can now move to the Sacral, a somewhat unusual Celtic inspired track that used various forms of indigenous percussion and even bagpipes! The piece is entitled Loucetious or Passion Rising Once more here the rhythm is the key, but also the resonance and the energy of the track as well and Get Tribal have created a collective of world instrumentation and sounds and brought to the world something very unique indeed.\nWe move with the swiftness of a Dragon to the third track entitled quite aptly Lei Shan or Sea Of Qi. Again setting the scene nicely, Get Tribal take us east on a journey of the inner self and we make a brief detour in our light body to the Dantien (The centre of our energetic life force) using once more indigenous drums and percussion, we are treated to a piece that has a light sense about it, but also has a deep resonance within as well, a well constructed composition that was not over complicated.\nFrom the gentle refrains of the East to the sheer power of track four known as Donnar or Awakening Power a very tribal orientated composition that represents the Solar Plexus Chakra. This track gives the listener a David Arkenstone moment of pure Lord of the Rings, using the Gregorian chant was a nice touch that added a time and a deeper feel and distinction to the composition.\nAt the half way stage we move back to the Emerald Isle for our Heart Chakra piece called Taranis or A Call to Heal I must admit that I have never had healing with Celtic music, but I am willing to give anything a go. This is a curious composition that uses Lute, Fiddles and various percussive instruments that will take us further on our healing journey and toward the very centre of our heart. A very cleverly played track that just before 3 minutes has a superb low sounding drum, that I wished had stayed for longer, or been used even more.\nDear constant reader we are on a journey through the elements that make up God of Drum by Get Tribal and now our journey through that realm takes us to a very tribal sounding composition called Flow of Expression this African themed song contains assorted Caribbean percussion, with Marimba and some Kari Hone vocalisation that I have not heard since Flaming Star from Sally Oldfield. A track that represents the throat Chakra does have a very fluent energy about it and is a very smooth and relaxing piece to play.\nWe move to the composition Open to Wonder, representative of the Brow Chakra. This has a wonderfully Middle Eastern feel to it and Adad, Babylon will have a real appeal across the musical board. Having seen a Turkish Oud in my time there, it was pleasing to see this being used on this very ethnic track and the heavier rock style drums gave us a real deep piece to delve to get into another favourite of mine this one.\nWe move swiftly onto Teshub Anatolia or Transcending Boundaries which for me, still had that element of Gregorian style within it, whilst being mixed with a Middle Eastern percussion and a Sitar, this is a real fusion mix of a composition and will be much liked across the world fusion beat community, the digitised vocal an added bonus here.\nThe next one was a new one to me, Chaac, Maya or Aligning with Purpose and representative of what is known as the 8th Chakra, or Soul Star Chakra, apparently located above the Crown chakra. This was also probably the most unique track off the album with South American drums and percussion, which gave us a perspective of not only Mayan energy, but also through the music an insight to our higher purpose.\nWhich dear constant readers take us to the end of our journey through God of Drum, by Get Tribal and we finish with an Indian based composition called Endless Reflection. This was a very calm and peaceful way to end the album, once more Get Tribal have brought a mixture of indigenous instrumentation to the musical table and succeeded with a delicate composition that was in fact the longest off the album and that in a way would be a slight criticism that I have of the project. I wished that some if not all of the tracks had been longer, especially the opening piece, Abundance.\nWith that being said God of Drum is certainly unique, its certainly fresh and its most defiantly very different from any Chakra based album that you will have ever heard before in the New Age genre. If you like albums with a good drum beat you will love this, if you like a world fusion theme, you will adore this album and if you like to find the occasional little gem of an album, in a world filled with wall to wall bubble gum music then God of Drum by Get Tribal will certainly lift you out of that malaise and bring your ears a treat of musical distinctiveness."

These primordial percussion beats will awaken your spirit and allow the energy to easily flow via 7 major chakras. And you will feel yourself balanced because this music attunes you to be together with the energies of the Universe. You sense yourself as an integral part of the pulsing world.\n\nGod of Drum is the newest release of Kari Hohne who undoubtedly is one of the most versatile people in the field of electronic music. Kari Hohne exemplifies the phrase she wears a lot of hats. Language preserver, master diver, best-selling author, tablet app designer, dream analyst, business consultant, Tai-Chi teacher and world traveler, Hohne created a unique musical project filled with unbridled power and boundless energy.\n\nOn the other hand the music of the album God of Drum is very sincere and natural. Filled with ethnic motifs it arouses emotions that were hidden deeply and gives release to them. So, one can say that the album ""God of Drum"" has a strong therapeutic effect and may be used for treatment of body, mind and soul.\n\nAll of these above mentioned features of the album ""God of Drum are certainly important. But maybe it has one more rare quality. This music is as wild as real life is."
"9951","4","","B00D01DG8Y","8927944f9170620db16f51af1f812a64OSYP","Get Tribal's ""God of Drum"" is a varied and really cool CD!  It blasts off with the chant like ""Wakinyan, American Indian"" with its hypnotic drum and flute.  ""Loucetious, Gaelic"" comes across like a Druid dance under the full moon.  I like ""Donnar, Norse"" with its almost military epic feel with the drums building and ""oh oh oh"" male vocals as counterpoint to the throbbing drumbeat.  ""Adad, Babylon"" exotically reflects the Middle East with its drums, snaking vocals and throbbing string sounds.  The concluding track, ""Indra, India,"" is a sitar-flavored meditation with the high-pitched ""Om shanti"" chorus.  I like this music very much.  Quite frankly, all the chakra information in the insert is off-putting to me, not significant nor particularly helpful to appreciate the music.  I think this is a strong disc for those of us who love inventive world music.  However, I would have greatly appreciated having more information about the instrurments, artist and music rather than a didactic lesson in chakraism*.  Enjoy!\n\n*Did I invent a new word!?!  :)"
"9952","5","","B00D01DG8Y","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","In my more than 30 years as a new age music journalist and reviewer, Ive seen and written about a number of albums specifically created to attune the energy centers or chakras of the body and spirit. However, God of Drum by Kari Hohne, who records under the name of Get Tribal, is certainly one of the most unique. She describes the album as a collection of percussion-based tribal music inspired by the thunder deities of world mythology. According to Kari: Each track was composed based on an archetype and shamanic drumming pattern from different parts of the world.  These reflect Native American, Celtic, Chinese, Norse, African, Mayan, and more. As can be expected, there is a broad spectrum of ethnic instruments, while her parallel interest in electronic music brings in synthesizers, samplers, and other contemporary sounds. Although meditation music is generally soft and soothing, Kari purposely sought to unlock energy.\n\nWhile there is a lot of metaphysics behind the music, and it can be helpful or interesting to know, ultimately its also fine to just press play and go with the flow. The album is a spirited multi-cultural musical experience that anyone can enjoy and groove to. But at its heart, God of Drum by Get Tribal is a powerful musical tool for unlocking energy to create harmony and balance. Her extensive research into archetypes, mythology, and shamanic studies is particularly evident in the music heard on the album. The emphasis on earthy rhythms and world music influences make this one of the most notable offerings in this particular genre. A lot of vision and creativity went into sonically designing each track, and it shows. For me, this album was a pleasant surprise, and one Id recommend in a heartbeat."
"9953","5","","B00D01DG8Y","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""God of Drum"" is a collection of ten original tribal music pieces inspired by the thunder deities of world mythology. The music was composed and performed by Get Tribal, the artist name of Kari Hohne, who is also a Mayan language preserver, master diver, best-selling author, tablet app designer, dream analyst, business consultant, Tai-Chi instructor, and world traveler - whew!\n\nAncient cultures revered thunder for activating spring each year and used drums to synchronize the heart, mind and soul with the vital life force. It is believed that the pounding of the drum awakens the heart, allowing us to achieve higher states of awareness. The ten tracks on this album are designed to stimulate the seven major Chakras as well as the Dantien, the Soul Star and Spirit Chakras, and the compositions reflect world-wide cultural influences that include Native American, Gaelic, Chinese, Norse, Celtic, African, Middle Eastern, Mayan, and Indian. It's an impressive and stirring album from a world music perspective as well as from a more earthy and sensual enjoyment of the pounding rhythms.\n\n""God of Drum"" begins with ""Call of Abundance,"" inspired by Wakinyan, the Thunder Bird of the Lakota and one of the many feathered serpents found in indigenous cultures. This piece is mostly drums and chant, with flutes and electronic effects floating a melody over the drum. I love the intensity and energy of ""Passion Rising,"" composed for Loucetious, a Gaelic deity. The powerful drums, chanting voices, and bagpipe-like sounds stimulate the sacral chakra, which can separate fear and anger from the sensation of pleasure. ""Donnar"" the Nordic thunder deity, inspired ""Awakening Power,"" which is very dark, intense and cinematic.  Powerful, hypnotic drumming meshes with wordless vocals, strings and organ to get the pulse pounding and the heart racing - another favorite. ""The Flow of Expression"" is quite different. Inspired by Xango from the Afro-Caribbean region, the piece has a Reggae beat and a chant intended to ""polish the mirror of the mind."" ""Open to Wonder"" is a haunting and exotic nod to Adad, the storm deity of Mesopotamia. The subtle changes in rhythm are designed to be unexpected in order to make us more receptive to a sense of wonder. ""Aligning With Purpose,"" inspired by the Mayan thunder deity, Chaac, is more orchestrated and cinematic. It is intended to stimulate the Soul Star chakra, which regulates our connection to a sense of purpose and helps us assimilate the wisdom of the higher self or purveyor of dreams. ""Endless Reflection,"" inspired by Indra, the thunder deity of India, contains a mantra that is sung throughout the peace, repeating the words, ""om"" (the sound of the universe) and ""shanti,"" which means peace. The combination of traditional Indian instruments and electronics creates a fascinating juxtaposition that brings the album to a peaceful close.\n\n""God of Drum"" is a mesmerizing musical exploration of thunder gods throughout history and from all corners of the world. Certain to stir the ears and soul as well as the chakras, Get Tribal has created a unique and inspiring work of musical art (I love the cover artwork, too!). Recommended!"

Rather, Suzuki uses Hiroshima as a jumping-off point to explore the journey of an imagined soul after the end of its corporeal life in a real catastrophe. Suzuki has basically created the soundtrack for that conceit.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is!\n\nAll the sounds on the disc are generated entirely by Suzuki's synthesizers, which is easy to forget because this is as far from sounding like electronic music as you can get. In fact, the music is very orchestral, but in a more solemn, heartfelt--rather than full-bore, bombastic---manner. Think searching, penetrating horns and strings.\n\nAlso telling is the fact that this is Suzuki's first international CD release to feature tracks with separate, distinct titles, furthering the effect of a story with a unique theme unfolding.\n\nThis is a bold musical statement from a visionary, continually evolving artist."
"9956","5","3","B00D02YNK8","889e6950d11de4656e04e9f09f9f9b5d20QH","Ray of the dawn scatters sleep\nAnd fear disappears like a shadow.\n\nThis strong electronic music captures the listener from the very beginning because it comes from the bottom of the artist's heart. You leave your habitual room and start the unusual journey. Its uncommonness is that it is a spiritual voyage. You are able to feel your inner self with all your true desires and yearnings, to realize the endlessness of the surrounded world and the space within you. This music helps to break the shell from the physical world in order to feel the spiritual world which is multidimensional.\n\nThe artist wrote: ""...the album is neither about the event [the Hiroshima atomic bomb tragedy] nor propaganda against the nuclear weapon. It is my imaginary story of someone who died in the event and is going through the unknown spiritual world."" These words beautifully describe the music of the album. Each of its compositions is like a painted picture, it has completeness and smoothly flows into the next one.\n\nTakashi Suzuki is a perfect composer. His music has a healing feature and inspires contemplation. It is easy to be in harmony with your emotional experiences while listening to ""Voyage"". Moreover, this music assists to strengthen the spirit and cures the tired heart. It has its own very special flavor.\n\nListen to ""Voyage"" without fail. This trip will not be an idle stroll, it will allow you to experience another world that is the reality itself."
"9957","5","","B00D02YNK8","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Voyage - Hiroshima Eternal"" is the third release from artist/sculptor/architect/electronic musician/composer Takashi Suzuki. Born and currently residing in Hiroshima, Japan, Suzuki  designed a monument for Edmund Blunden's poem, ""A Song for August 6th, 1949,"" which won first place in a competition in 1975 and stands in the garden of The Hiroshima Central Library. The sculpture features the words to the poem in both English and Japanese and is still a stunning and moving tribute to the spirit and resilience of the city and its people following one of the darkest days of modern history. Despite the title, the music composed for this album is neither a memorial nor a protest against nuclear weapons. It is Suzuki's imaginary story of someone who died in the event and then journeys through the unknown spiritual world. The eight tracks and their titles are the imagined stages of the journey, ending with reincarnation and a new life.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Suzuki composes his music in a similar manner to creating his visual artwork, finishing one piece before moving to the next and allowing the previous work to influence the new work. This gives his music a linear quality and continuity that is its own evolution. Very minimal as well as ambient, the music has a dark, soulful quality that is sometimes mysterious or mournful and sometimes a bit lighter and more hopeful (but not joyous). The mood lightens gradually as the journey progresses and the spirit finds its way and discovers its purpose. Created with synths, the instrumentation includes ethereal and atmospheric sounds, strings, voices, bells, light percussion, and other sounds without any specific cultural reference. As with Suzuki's previous releases, the sound quality is full and rich. ""Resonance,"" his debut, received the 2011 Best Ambient Album award from Zone Music Reporter, and ""Cycle"" was nominated as the Best Relaxation/Meditation Album and Best Ambient Album for 2012 by the same organization. I would fully expect similar acclaim for ""Voyage,"" another extraordinary musical experience from this fascinating artist."
"9958","5","","B00D02YNK8","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","""Voyage"" is the third release from Japanese musician/ painter/ sculptor/ architect Takashi Suzuki following his critically acclaimed and award nominated ""Cycle"" CD, and his debut album, ""Resonance,"" which was named ""Best Ambient Album"" in the 2012 ZMR Awards. His music has been well received and he has developed a compositional style that bears resemblance to his minimalist painting style. ""Voyage"" exudes a Zen-like serene spaciousness. From the monochromatic cover art to the sparse uncluttered graphics, everything about this release is ultimately ambient. On the inside, a poem that pays tribute to the spirit of his home city of Hiroshima. The album references the tragic event that happened there in 1945 from the imaginary perspective of someone who died in the bombing and is making a transition through the unknown spiritual world and the realizations that come at the end.\n\nThe expansive soundscapes drift from track to track maintaining a homogeneous vibe through out. There is a sense of continuity that flows from one song to the next carried by Takashi's signature style that is more about texture than melody. What I wrote about his ""Cycle"" CD is equally true for ""Voyage:"" ""Following in the comparison to Zen, the music is more about `being' than `doing.' Synthesizers provide the medium he creates his `ambient tone poems' with. The waves and washes of sound can best be described as floating, dreamy, and atmospheric and lend themselves to meditative states and quiet reflection."" Comparisons have been made to Takashi's music and that of Brian Eno's early ambient albums, Steve Roach's ""Structures from Silence,"" and particularly the ""Liquid Mind ""series. I feel that there has been an evolution in Takashi Suzuki's music with each successive album he has released.  For me, ""Voyage"" is his best work so far. Given the critical and popular success his music has enjoyed, I'm sure that this album will appeal to his listeners as much or more."

Their latest song takes them back to the success of songs they have had in the 90's with songs like Iris and Name. Their latest song Rebel Beat form their 2013 record Magnetic, actually is a upbeat and driven song. It definitely is catchy and strong with what John Reznik and the guys have badly needed, after having some lackluster songs for the past several years. It definitely is much better than the joke songs that many of today's artists have shown. I hope there are ore good songs like this from the guys from Buffalo, New York soon.

As Martha recalls ""As part of my job I had to audition other artists, schedule musicians, maintain studio logs and be 'girl-friday' to all the writers and producers. If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $5.00 each."" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days, Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door. You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del-Fi's. Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group. Soon the Del-Fi's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye's early records. Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special. The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single ""Come And Get These Memories"". It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group.\n\nMotown wasted little time in issuing the follow-up single. Released in early August 1963 ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave"" would become one of the biggest records of that summer peaking at #4. To me the pulsating sounds of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were the personification of Motown's moniker ""The Sound of Young America"" and this is one of the finest examples. Five stars all the way baby!"

However, I would rate several other Two Steps from Hell albums ahead of this one (including Classics 2), but that is only because other TSFH albums are so epic and amazing, not because this album is not good. This kind of music is perfect for just about anything. I enjoy listening while driving, studying, washing dishes, killing zombies, showering, etc. Two Steps from Hell has a piece for any situation or event I can think of. If you are a diehard TSFH fan, I would highly recommend buying this album asap. If you are new to TSFH or the ""epic music"" genre then I would recommend starting out with other albums from TSFH first such as Battlecry, Vanquish, or Invincible.\nHighlights on the album: Nemesis, Jump!, Sons of War, Eternal Sorrow (this one is a beautiful, sad, amazing piece!), The Ancients, Ironheart, The World is Mind.

But Michele has had honestly the most to prove after the trio broke up in voice. If We Had Your Eyes, the latest song from Michelle is not a bad song, but not actually as striking as other songs. Still it is a very uplifting song that speaks well from Michelle. Still, it isn't one of her better songs, but at least it is much better than the lackluster songs that have been on radio.

Nor are any minor or perhaps spurious works. But pretty much everything else of consequence is included. It's a motherlode of music for the harpsichord by perhaps the greatest composer the instrument ever knew. Tons of great stuff, from the English and French Suites, to the Partitas and Toccatas, to both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier, to the Goldberg Variations and Inventions. My one quibble is that this music can get very repetitive very quickly. Of course, there is no way of playing dynamics on a harpsichord, so there is no real difference between soft and loud. Work after work can sound pretty much the same. Thank God Bach was such a stupendous genius!\n  Martin Galling is a name that I'm not too familiar with, but he plays wonderfully, if a bit sewing-machine like at times. This is something the real Bach freaks will love. Moderate classical music listeners might like it too for it's immense size (over 15 hours says the label on the front). Glenn Gould fans should run away, run far away! But overall, I can't really say much more than: Recommended.---------------------------PEACE"

The interplay between the vocals and the guitar is phenomenal. The blend of the softly stated electric guitar played by John Gnossis and the unusual voice of Katie Bernstein transform this song from a good song to a great one.  Katie Bernstein's voice has a bit of a twang, but not in an even remotely country and western style.  Instead, her voice is filled with expression, as are the guitar lines, which are played in quite an expressive and emotive manner."

That has definitely shown with the songs from his latest record The Diving Board, and Home Again, the lead single from that album is definitely no exception. I love the mood and its simplicity from the keys pf Elton John's piano, to how the deepness of the song still hits from the down to Earth appeal of his classic songwriting and musicianship. It really is up there with all of the great songs that made Elton's dynasty strong like Your Song and Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.

That has showed well over the years, and that his classic songs still have stood that test of time. Home Again, his latest song from the album The Diving Board is definitely one of the best songs out there right now. I love the simplicity from the piano notes and what Elton puts into the song. It is really a delightful song worth listening too. As he had recently performed at the Emmy Awards, earlier this year, it shows that you can always definitely go back home again, with a great appreciation from a great artist. If you haven't heard any Elton John song before, this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: A"

It's one of those instrumental discs that rise to a short list of playlist favorites.  The musicianship of the players is first rate.  The songs are distinctive.  For example, ""Gliding"" is a lovely track that starts out wistfully and reflective and then changes into a lighthearted piece filled with exhilaration and a sense of freedom -- as if one were gliding over the earth.  Perhaps a companion piece to that track is ""Running On Joy"" which has lighthearted piano trills with Heather Rankin's wispy vocals and will Ackerman giving an underlying buzz on the Australian didgeridoo.  ""Antarctica"" has a stately classical feeling.  ""Naked Love"" is a bittersweet melodic track with Rebecca Daniel's gorgeous violin sending the track into the stratosphere.  Fiona Joy Hawkins has done a masterful job on letting the music take us to different moods and planes.  The cover photograph by Andy Wilson and the artwork by Warren Scott that turns a glacier into a piano keyboard sets a stark but inventive tone for this excellent disc.  Enjoy!"

"10444","3","","B00DY9A8NI","be4edae88f523c6a2ae48376fde792280IA6","This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.\n  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE"

At the offered price, this collection truly is AMAZING.  Do not be concerned that the renderings by the orchestras here are only on par with your local high school band, as you'll be hard pressed to discern any difference in these professional performances from those of even the most renowned orchestras. I believe your pleasure from listening to this collection will be as great as your pleasure at having acquired it for so little. A safer bet doesn't likely exist."

Im also lucky to have been able to hear this song online and on radio station across the various states that my husband and I have lived (florida, Maryland, Virginia). From my perspective, all mixed up by 311 appears to be about figuring out the wisest actions and the best ways for an individual to go along in their life while successfully separating a sea of both critical and well-meaning people who may be trying to steer a man or woman another way. With the lyrics, trust your instincts, Im guessing that all mixed up by 311 symbolizes tuning into your intuition as the smoothest way to go when trying to successfully separate what a person wishes to personally do in comparison to what their critics, friends, and/or family members may tell them."

Of her repertoire, I find ""Angel"" to be her best song -- it's emotional without being over-the-top, and has a quiet, laid-back piano accompaniment that doesn't overwhelm the singer's voice.

I recall how it instantly dominated radio and record sales for weeks on end.\nIts true legacy is its clear ownership of launching the rhythm of an entire genre, rap/hip hop. From The Sugarhill Gang's maiden flagship, ""Rapper's Delight"" to 2013's Daft Punk's ""Around the World"". It has been the sound bed for everything from Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust"", Blondie's ""Rapture"" to Wham's ""Wham's Rap"".\nIt is the seminal sampled track that will undoubtedly be in the Grammy Hall of Fame and even the National Library of Congress."

The rest of the songs range from come ons to girls to typical contempary R&B sounds of bragging, sex, etc. Nothing really new. I guess you could say that his last album before this (not counting the one he did with Bow Wow),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21/dp/B000H30BW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21</a>&nbsp;was in a similar vein. HOWEVER, although ""21"" talked about sex too mostly it had bangin', current beats to accompany the songs. That is the difference that ultimately makes this more mediocre than his last solo project.\n\nSo in the end, this project unlike ""21"" is pretty skip-able. There aren't really any money tracks at all although if you like your typical topics of R&B in 2010 and beyond, you might be right at home with this album. All I know is that he's capable of more.\n\n3 stars."

However after a good first album, he followed it up with the equally bad 21 which did nothing to show off his vocal talent. With Olluison, Omarion is singing songs that truly show he was and always will be nothing more than a studio singer."

But every once in a while a great songwriter has had a song that is alright, but not anything to rave about. Made To Love, the third single from his album Love In The Future, is alright but it doesn't actually ignite to the best that matches with his other tracks from the album like Who Do We Think We Are and All Of Me had shown. Still, it isn't a bad song but not really as good as I have heard from John before. Still, this is a good song to download if you are a fan of his, but for anyone who is new to his music."

But sadly, she has been overlooked in the credibility in favor the annoying Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna. Her collaboration with Erykah Badu Q.U.E.E.N. from her sophmore album The Electric Lady is definitely a great collaboration. I love how rhythmic Janelle brings her voice into the song and the rhythm staying connected to the artists of soul that had inspired her to sing. It shows that she has a great rhythm into the song for old school and contemporary R&B that many of today's artists disregard well. This is a great song to dance to, and a nice follow-up to what she had with Tightrope a few years ago.\n\nSong: B"

Quite apart from the sheer visual and tactile whack of this thing - the big news for fans is brand new remasters from first generation tapes by TIM YOUNG in conjunction with the band at Metropolis Studios in London. We should talk about the REMASTERS because they're fabulous. Tim Young's notes in the ""Extras"" 3-disc set explain that ""Rope"" has had the first generation tapes used for the first time to his knowledge - so I immediately went to my favourite track ""Guns On The Roof"" - and WOW is the only appropriate response. It sounds just incredible with all that guitar power you always thought was buried in the mix somewhere now to the fore. ""Drug-Stabbing Time"" and ""Stay Free"" are even better - leaping out of your speakers with renewed venom.\n\n""London Calling"" is like a different animal (""Jimmy Jazz"", ""Death Or Glory"" and ""Train In Vain"" are unbelievably good with ""Train"" running out longer by about five seconds) - but to my ears ""Sandinista!"" feels the least improved. It's definitely clearer on the bass and rhythm section (""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Call Up"" and Timon Dogg'svocal on ""Lose This Skin"") but the differences are not as stark as the first 3 LPs - they're just subtler. Despite the sprawl of ""Sandinista!"" - I've always loved it precisely because its like ""The White Album"" or ""Exile On Main St."" or ""Physical Graffiti"" - you can dip into it and still seemingly find something new every time. The choral brass arrangements at the beginning of ""Somewhere In England"" is now gorgeous while the game-machine noises on ""Ivan Meets G.I. Joe"" are even more manic. ""Somebody Got Murdered"" and their take on Eddy Grant's ""Police On My Back"" are much improved - ballsy as they should be. Back to ""London Calling"" and I'm impressed with ""Lost In The Supermarket"" and ""Brand New Cadillac"" - comparing them against my 1999 versions - there's more going on with the high hats, drums and bass. And that Rock 'n' Roll guitar as ""Brand New Cadillac"" begins punches way above its former weight now. I also love the way each of the CDs has their original vinyl bits reproduced - the ""Armagideon Times"" for ""Sandinista!"", the inner sleeves of ""London Calling"" made into one fold-out lyric poster - the inner and poster of ""Combat Rock"" combined in the same way - and all the CDs are black like vinyl LPs. The driving backbeat behind ""Combat Rock's"" Side 2 standout ""Overpowered By Funk"" is a little improved but I can't say I hear much difference in ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go"".\n\nI own the Singles Box Set on CD so I compared the remasters and again the ""Extras"" versions are far superior - that guitar into on ""Clash City Rocker"" and distant Strummer vocal are better - and the balls of ""I Fought The Law"" is truly fantastic (a cover of an old Bobby Fuller Four hit). And my favorite B-side ever - their genius take on Willie Williams reggae tune ""Armagideon Time"" sounds like its going to do your speakers harm. That amazing bass and percussive beginning of ""The Magnificent Dance"" (the 12"" remix) has jaw-dropping sound quality as does the US 12"" B-side ""The Cool Out"" (an instrumental version of ""The Call Up"") - both with meaty rhythm sections. The early Polydor demos show a band getting there and the expert Glyn Johns produced that amateur feel out of the first album. I'm not sure I like them having loved the originals for all these years. Other disappointments include the outtakes on Disc 2 like ""The Beautiful People..."" and ""Kangaroo Court"" which are wholly dismissible and ""Sean Flynn"" has huge hiss levels on it. But I'm glad to see that Metropolis again mastered the DVD because the picture quality on the Don Letts and Clash On Broadway segments is brill (you get a sense of their danger live).\n\nTo sum up - ""The Last Gang In Town"" and ""The Only Band That Ever Mattered"" - there's been an awful lot of knob written about The Clash across the years (what about the Ramones, The Pistols or even Television) - and ""Sound System"" conveniently exorcises out the infamous and horrible end of ""Cut The Crap"" in 1985. You could also argue that you'd be better off just spending twenty quid on the simpler ""5 Studio Albums Box Set"" released in tandem with this - but I'd say if ever a band deserved this kind of over-the-top celebration - then England's heroes The Clash are the boys. And when you think of how EMI has consistently cheaped-out Stranglers fans with card sleeves and little else - thank God Sony stumped up. I love the care and attention that went into ""Sound System"". So there you have it - all those old bits spangly new again and presented to us in a fabulous setting.\n\nTim Young has described remastering The Clash's six years of output as a 'labour of love'. Well - while the future may indeed be unwritten - I suspect his brilliant work here (in conjunction with surviving members of the band) will be written about for decades to come. Well done and Career Opportunities to all involved...\n\nPS: as of December 2014 - Amazon's price has fallen from over eighty to sixty four quid - perfect gift territory for the Clash City Rocker in your life..."

Frankly I heard a portion of this song while partially listening to something my spouse was watching but it was enough to have me listen to a sample and then purchase the MP3.  I found the lyrics to be such that they struck a cord and the music not quite as abusive as others.  In summary I like it very much and I think you will too."

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWhile a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE / CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price / Albums by Price (on left side of screen)"

She honestly has been underrated as one of the most dynamic singers that had ever came out the past 50 years. Honestly, her daughter then son made more headlines than her the past several years, Chastity now Chaz, by becoming a man and then making his way as a part of Dancing With The Stars. Cher also coming pop retirement has decided to try and deliver in her own work again with singing. But honestly, her return hasn't been the big, "" Wow, I have got to have this moment that it!,"" it could've been. Her song Woman's World, from her 20123 album Closer To The Truth isn't a bad song, but honestly not as big as when she came back on top in the 90's with songs like Strong Enough and Believe. It is alright, but honestly not a strong song that dominates, but it still is classic Cher alone. If you are a die hard fan of Cher's than you'll download this song, but otherwise go back to songs like Song For The Lonely to make it more worth the effort.\n\nSong: C+"

It is very atmospheric, and is something that I would expect to hear playing in the background of a movie about ghosts, as the tension is building towards the climax.  The second half of the song is a bit more upbeat, with a quicker tempo and more metallic highlights, but it would still be quite at home in a ghost movie.  It seems to drag on a bit longer than what seemed realistic for a song of this type, since the tension cannot last forever.  The weakest part of the song played out in the last 10 seconds or so, with seemingly otherworldly transmissions that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the song.  But it was offered as part of a free promotional download, and for that, I'll round the rating up to four stars."

""Groove Jazz N Chill #3"" from the ""Chillaxing Jazz Kollektion"" features the relaxing sounds of the prolific, globe-trotting 'smooth jazz' composer, arranger, producer and saxophonist Konstantin Klastorni. It has jazzy, relaxing, swinging music with an exotic sound and hypnotic beats. The vibe of the first track ""Nothing Without You"" sets the mood for the entire recording as he mixes in a variety of smooth acoustic and electronic sounds over an infectious beat, mixing in guitars, keyboards, and saxes which trade leads. But he 'ups the ante' with the laid back beauty of ""Inside You"" with the 'call-response' of sax and guitar. Other outstanding tracks include ""Every Good Thing"", the soothing mixture of synth and guitar on ""Like A River"", the funky flutes, synth, and guitar on ""Beautiful Day"", the arian-sounds of ""That's Life"", the oriental sound of ""Good Morning"" and the floating sax notes of ""Blue Pacific"". Highly Recommended. Five RELAXING Stars! (Kvk Music. 10 MP3 tracks. Time-48:40.)"

Very nice bass that maintains your attention behind quality male vocal over good sounding band. Nothing fancy song that sounds great. Wikipedia says Alt. Country, they sound better than that label. Like it a lot. These guys have been around a while, every song encourages you to listen to more.\n\nPendulum by Pure Bathing Culture. Love the smooth opening, slight Christopher Cross vibe (do not hold that against them)I also felt an I'm Not In Love by 10cc vibe, because I'm old. Very cool, echo female vocal over quality synthesizer rhythms that ebb & flow w/great low key choral background. Song maintains cool slight psychedelic feel for the duration. No idea what the rest of their music sounds like. Absolutely love this track.\n\nGMF by John Grant. I should be too old to find this simple s/sw song brilliant, but I do. Low key acoustic guitar & controlled synthesizers behind male lead vocal telling his story. The hook is what GMF stands for. It's included as the chorus of this okay singer songwriter number. Do not play with the kids in the car. Play for your old enough friends & surprise them. Greatest m f that you're ever gonna meet.\n\nThings Will Change by Treetop Flyers. Hate to compare new with old, 'try to do it only to compliment. This song sounds like an updated version of any classic by America (the band). Strumming acoustic guitar, tight backing band, similar male lead vocal, great lyrics, great sound, good production, quality song. Love it.\n\nNerve Endings by Eagulls. Brilliant punk opening, vocal & song. Sounds like past punk greats.(Not gonna compare) Strong back beat, great guitar & neat straining lead vocal. Song never strays from it's core of excellent. Absolutely love it.\n\nWaiting by The Dismemberment Plan. Neat lightweight Indie, post-punk revival, math rock, post-hardcore, experimental rock (thank you Wikipedia). Open male vocal over bopping band. Nice.\n\nParted Ways by Heartless Bastards. Recognizable, slightly shrill male lead vocal way in front of good sounding band keeping up with lyrics, allowed to play a little, couple of times. Noisy ending, nothing wrong with this song, you will love it.\n\nThey Told Me by Sallie Ford & The Sound Outside. Love the throbbing opening, strong female vocal over ongoing rocking band that threatens & defends the singer throughout. Very nice.\n\nLos Angeles by Emily Wells. Per Wikipedia Folk, Folk rock, Folktronica, Acoustic. This track is breathy female vocal over guitar w/neat lyrics and not much else. You will love it, she has done much more.\n\nDogon Genesis by Lumerians. Great simple opening, vocals start, psychedelia ensues. Too many genres in Wiki to list, neat feel, deliberate vocal over speedy guitars including relentless bass. Superior version of modern progressive track. Like it(they mentioned 'Silver Machine' how not to like?).\n\nBermuda Highway by Christopher Denny. Female sounding vocal, appears he's not, let's say Roy Orbison. Acoustic guitar, deliberate spoken vocal that sings to us all, harmonica spurts, quality lyrics, complete sound. Like it.\n\nThis superior sampler from Partisan Records is worth money right now. Download a fantastic free collection of quality songs from a mix of genres, you may not like them all, someone you know will love the songs you don't. Excellent collection, this sampler is the good stuff, get it while it's free."

Antonio Carlos Jobim had gone from Brazilian Bossa Nova legend to a big name regular in the Creed Taylor CTI Jazz stable.  I was one of those who picked it up even though Frank Sinatra was my Fathers music, he was still cool and probably more so in the 70s because he went from covering My Music (Heres to you Mrs. Robinson, ooby dooby doo) to doing some stand up appreciable real jazz and resembling the towering mighty man who fronted Harry James and Tony Dorseys orchestras and rose to superstardom in the 50s and made cool-jazz music with His Highness Basie.  The only way to lay your hands on this prize was as an import in places like Tower Records or if you knew of its existence you could have your mom and pop record store order it for you at a price.  Only Jobim fans and extremely serious Sinatra fans knew about it from articles.  The other way to get this material was to back order the old Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra & Company (1971) but you were still left without three of the tracks they did together: ""Bonita"", ""Sabi"", and ""Off Key (Desafinado)"".  The 10 track Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim, arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, accompanied by a studio orchestra, is very nice but the real prize was the eagerly sought other half of the Sessions arranged by Deodato (stable-mate of Jobim in CTI, and 2nd greatest Brazilian jazz man after Jobim alongside the Joo Gilberto family) and conducted by Morris Stoloff.  Of particular note: Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Darn those Beatles!  Sinatra and Jobim worked together for a final time in 1994 on Duets II, recording a cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" if you want to be complete you will have to get that one too!\n\nThe original collection of Sinatra & Jobim tracks on their collaborations included two recordings which do not actually feature Jobim, ""Drinking Again"" and ""Manh De Carnaval.  SINATRA/JOBIM: THE COMPLETE REPRISE RECORDINGS does not include them, instead you get all 20 original recordings featuring both artists in their work of genius together.  As Amazon does not see fit to give you the track listings on the CD, here is the full lineup with credits:\n\n1. The Girl from Ipanema (Antnio Carlos Jobim, Norman Gimbel, Vincius de Moraes)  3:20\n2.  Dindi (Ray Gilbert, Jobim, Aloysio de Oliveria)  3:31\n3.  Change Partners (Irving Berlin)  2:43\n4.  Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Jobim, Gene Lees)  2:45\n5.  Meditation (Jobim, Gimbel, Newton Mendona)  2:55\n6.  If You Never Come to Me (Jobim, Gilbert, de Oliveira)  2:11\n7.  How Insensitive (Jobim, Gimbel, de Moraes)  3:18\n8.  I Concentrate on You (Cole Porter)  2:39\n9.  Baubles, Bangles and Beads (Robert Wright, George Forrest, Alexander Borodin)  2:36\n10.  Once I Loved (O Amor em Paz) (Jobim, Gilbert, de Moraes)  2:38\n11.  The Song of the Sabia (Sabi) (Jobim, Chico Buarque, Gimbel)  3:40\n12.  Drinking Water (Agua de Beber) (de Moraes, Jobim, Gimbel)  2:37\n13.  Someone to Light Up My Life (de Moraes, Jobim, Lees)  2:40\n14.  Triste (Jobim)  2:42\n15.  This Happy Madness (Estrada Branca) (de Moraes, Jobim, Lees)  2:57\n16.  One Note Samba (Samba de Uma Nota So) (Jobim, Mendona)  2:22\n17.  Don't Ever Go Away (Por Causa de Voc) (Gilbert, Dolores Duran, Jobim)  2:30\n18.  Wave (Jobim)  3:21\n19.  Off Key"" (Desafinado) (Lees, Jobim, Mendona)  3:09\n20.  Bonita (Gilbert, Jobim, Lees)  3:40\n\nFrank Sinatra  vocals\nAntnio Carlos Jobim  vocals, guitar\nClaus Ogerman  arranger, conductor (Tracks 1-10)\nEumir Deodato  arranger (Tracks 11-20)\nMorris Stoloff  conductor (Tracks 11-20)\n\nThis is the 2010 the Concord Records label re-issue imported by Universal (United Kingdom) and has been remastered beautifully.

"11624","5","","B00FU2YV8A","0378d42d2af1f922ba0963cc1cf68c26YZYF","Paul Spaeth returns with a collection of eleven solo piano performances (with some cello and violin) that are resplendent with transcendent serenity.\n\nAs art is subjective, Spaeth went into this recording with his own vision of what the music represents, and listeners will come away from the music with meanings that are specific to them.\n\nWhat is definitely not open to interpretation is Spaeth's talent for original, creative compositions and exquisite, nuanced playing. The tunes range in variety from gentle and tranquil to epic and grandiose, and Spaeth's mastery of the keyboard enables him to command different styles and techniques to elicit those diverse moods.\n\nThe album also features Tina Guo on cello and Christopher Luther on violin.\n\nThis is a fine and worthy entry in the solo piano genre."
"11625","5","2","B00FU2YV8A","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","With all the recognition, and awards he has garnered, including a Recording Academy Grammy Scholarship Award, Paul has certainly achieved a remarkable amount for someone barely 30 years old. With that in mind, I was amazed to learn that his latest release, ""Redemption,"" has been 10 years in the making - one third of his life! The first track entitled ""A Lifetime Spent,"" is an introspective solo piano melody draws us in, slowly building in intensity, and becoming quite dramatic. There is a cinematic air to Paul's playing, although certainly not surprising given his background and education in composition and film scoring. An interesting contrast came towards the end when after a dramatic flourish, the piece appears to end, but after a moment of silence, is followed by the most delicate coda, providing a musical yin yang experience. The next song is an emotionally evocative tune called ""To Say Goodbye."" Unlike the diversity displayed in the previous track, this one stays more on the bittersweet side of the spectrum, and is sure to resonate in the hearts of anyone who has experienced loss and separation in life.\n\nTracks four and five create a two-part story, respectively titled, "" Prelude to a Lullaby,"" and ""Lullaby for the Mending Heart."" These are the first of the duets heard on the album, and feature the exquisite cello artistry of Tina Guo. Tina is now performing in the Cirque du Soleil show ""Michael Jackson: The Immortal."" Another beautiful duet is heard on track 8 with a rendition of the classic ""Amazing Grace."" This song features the superbly talented accompaniment of Christopher Luther on violin. The final duet with cellistTina Guo is on track 10, entitled ""This Is Our Faith."" Here, as on his work in general, Paul exhibits his mastery of composition as the piece flows through various movements and feelings.\n\n""Redemption"" by Paul Spaeth is a deeply personal musical experience that draws inspiration from the well of Life. Capable of spanning vast emotional terrain, Paul's music ranges from introspective and impressionistic, to powerful and dramatic expressions of profound feelings that resonate in the innermost being of the listener. Each composition is a perfectly told story that speaks to the experiences we all share. Emotionally evocative and spiritually uplifting, ""Redemption"" is an inspired work of art from the heart of a gifted composer."
"11626","5","3","B00FU2YV8A","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","Paul Spaeth released his first album, a piano and orchestral CD called ""Cobalt Blue,"" in 2001, when he was still a teenager. At 17, he premiered his first orchestral piece and then entered the University of Southern Californias Thornton School of Music for composition and film scoring. Since then, he has written music for film, TV and video games as well as the eleven tracks for his new album, ""Redemption.""  Composed over a ten-year period, ""Redemption"" expresses a young mans personal experiences of life and love, coming of age, and finding ones truth. Seven of the eleven tracks are solo piano and four feature Tina Guo on cello or Christopher Luther on violin. This intensely personal music has been described as soothing and healing (physical, emotional, and spiritual), but it is also simply great music expressed with deep passion and an exquisite piano touch. It gives me great hope for the future of music that young artists like Paul Spaeth can carry the torch and keep their music a pure art form rather than simply a business proposition. This is an amazing album and one I fully expect to be one of my favorites for the year.\n\n""Redemption"" begins with A Lifetime Spent, a gorgeous piano solo that powerfully expresses a whole range of emotions with passion and intensity. Breathtaking! To Say Goodbye is much more introspective - a bit of musical soul-searching. I expected track 3 to be a piece about rain, but it is titled Reflections. A bit more abstract and free-form, it has a very haunting quality. Prelude to a Lullaby is a duet for piano and cello that provides a gentle massage for the soul. It segues into Lullaby for the Mending Heart, also for cello and piano, and just as relaxing as its Prelude. The Moment After is my favorite track. Very spare and subtle, it conveys so much with so little. Something profound has happened here, and the music expresses tremendous loss and longing - and a naked, personal truth. A New Beginning lightens the mood considerably with feelings of hope and the anticipation of a fresh start. The melody is simple, but sincere and honest. I really like this one, too! Amazing Grace follows as a duet for violin and piano. Very slow and earthy, this well-worn nugget shines as brand new. Passage can mean many things, but in this case, the piece is almost celebratory with a gospel tinge, gathering energy as it evolves and ending with excitement and perhaps triumph. This Is Our Faith is a gorgeous duet for piano and cello, sharing deep from the heart and revealing the soul at its most honest and vulnerable. Incredibly moving and another favorite. The title track ends the album with a piece that is both dramatic and tender, again expressing a personal truth.\n\n""Redemption"" is an emotional powerhouse, but is never over-the-top or overly sentimental. This is music that needs to be heard, and I hope to be able to spread the word to help give Paul Spaeth the audience he deserves. I give ""Redemption"" my highest recommendation!"
"11627","5","2","B00FU2YV8A","8927944f9170620db16f51af1f812a64OSYP","Paul Spaeth's ""Redemption"" is a glorious, uplifting set of solo piano music.  Emotions pour through Spaeth's masterful piano, like a picnic for the soul.  The opening track ""A Lifetime Spent"" grabs you immediately with its highs and lows, from exhilaration to reflection.  On ""Prelude to a Lullaby,"" Tina Guo on cello and Christopher Luther on violin give counterpoint to Spaeth's gentle soothing melody.  ""Lullaby for the Mending Heart"" is an impressive piece with its orchestral build.  ""A New Beginning"" is well titled, holding hope high.  ""Amazing Grace"" has such a beautiful melody and exudes strength in the interplay between piano & strings.  ""This Is Our Faith"" with the cello is exquisite piece of music, lovely and touching.  At the end of the final title track when Paul strokes those few strong chords, it resounds with such certainty of spirit that we are left with this breathtaking reverberation in the soul.  ""Redemption"" feels like more than music, it is an experience.  Bravo!"

Matrix mixes have been around a while but this is the first official Grateful Dead archive release to do this.\n\nThe Grateful Dead had a strong year in 1980. They introduced several new songs at the beginning of the year, celebrated their 15th Anniversary while  playing acoustic sets in September and October. These acoustic sets also saw the return of songs that had been put away for a while. The band was also recording shows that would make two live two l.p. set releases the next year.\n\nThis show marks the fourth show since the Radio City Music Hall show. The band's mini November tour started on the 26 and by the time the 30th rolled around, the band was on a roll.\n\nThe first set starts with Feel Like A Stranger and it takes a few adjustments to get everything dialed in just exactly right. That doesn't stop the band from building this to a high octane jam. Loser starts with a nice tempo and builds to a cool finish. Cassidy is short and well played but the jams are only hinted at during this era. Ramble On Rose is stretched out nicely with Jerry firing it up during the solos. Little Red Rooster gives Bob a chance to show off his blues chops. It's also nice to hear Brent's electric piano up in the mix which doesn't always happen. Next up, a real treat in the first electric Bird Song since September 1973. Bird Song had been brought back in the acoustic sets but this was it in it's new arrangement for the first time in an electric set. The Me And My Uncle->Big River moves along at a nice clip while It Must Have Been The Roses is sweetly played. It's another song that was brought back during the acoustic sets. The first set ends with hot versions of Lost Sailor->Saint Of Circumstance->Deal.\n\nThe second set begins with a hot Scarlet->Fire that, while not a super long version, is still a standout. Samson rocks hard and the ballad Ship Of Fools is very well done. The long second set jam starts with a 15 minute plus Playing In The Band that goes to some cool places before drifting into the Drums->Space segment. I guess that there are some out there that don't like Drums->Space segments but I do. Out of Space, we get a mellow The Wheel and a pretty China Doll. Bob rocks the set to a close with a Chuck Berry medley while Uncle John's Band is a great encore. All in all, everybody is on and it was a very good night for everyone."

It a nice soundtrack to let your mind go wandering and thinking about something else, but while the performance level is strong except for some squeaky guitar strings which is a pet peeve of mine, no melodies are particularly memorable.  ""On the Border"" written by Al Stewart is my favorite track on the set.  ""Rhapsody in Blood"" is unsettling with the music not leading into the blood-curdling screams.  I know some will enjoy the track; I did not.  I had to listen closely to John Lennon's ""Imagine"" to recognize the melody.  This is not a bad set, nor a particularly good one.  If you're looking for some instrumental acoustic guitar, you're in the right place."
"11942","5","","B00GHG5524","0378d42d2af1f922ba0963cc1cf68c26YZYF","Denver, Colorado-based guitar player and instructor Tom Carleno ventures out on his first solo recording, and it's quite the auspicious debut.\n\nThis is not your standard solo acoustic finger style guitar album, as many of the compositions are written and performed with alternate tunings. Carleno's creativity displays his ear for unusual and stirring tunes, and his dexterity on the guitar is masterful. Carleno is also joined on one track by his wife Josie Quick, who provides unique percussion by way of spoons.\n\nThis is a fine album that should appeal to fans of solo acoustic finger style guitar as well as anyone who enjoys original captivating music."
"11943","5","","B00GHG5524","7bde9f42f454ec55543fc987fbcc97c426Z0","I cannot express how nice it was to get to review a guitar based album, as one who strums the strings of power myself it was good to get to grips with Perfect Imperfection from Tom Carleno. This is an album of very clever and adept finger style guitar playing by a man who clearly has a great depth and passion for his music; you can see this on track one called In Search Of. A delightful negative refrain at times, then some very inspired notes give us an emotive but delightful way to start an album.\nThis album has come at a good time for me, I needed to relax and ease back and my life lately as could be yours, has been frantic, to put it mildly. Perfect Imperfection was the perfect vehicle for me to do so and this next piece was superb, its called Meet me in Maui. Laid back and chilled and already through this music I can feel the inner peace beginning to flow.\nWhen I first started working in radio, I came across the artist Al Stewart and I actually ended up with a show called On The Border after hearing Year of the Cat, I would of course find Als other well know composition of that very name and Carleno does a literal walk through of this classic Stewart song and does it with reverence to its originality, but with a fresh Latin feel to it as well, excellent rendition, played and performed with style and grace and yes I was singing the lyrics along with it!\nNow an interesting title, my dear constant readers, you all know I delight in fresh and new ideas and especially innovative titles, so when Welcome To The Milky Way came on I was in rapture. This is played so beautifully and in an almost ancient style that could take the listener back across the eons of time, across that very Milky Way, there are some very pleasant harmonics on this track as well.\nIts time to raise the rhythm and take the whole venture up tempo, using the guitar in every aspect on Working up an Appetite. There was some great use of the frets, strings and main body of the guitar. On this piece Carlino shows his mastery and shows it well, at around two minutes forty, there is a charming quiet passage that sold this piece for me as one of the best on the album and the powerful chords at the end made it an awesome composition that should take you by the ears and drag you to musical heaven.\nBut wait dear constant reader, there is much more, this next track is so mood filled you will not want to miss out on another enjoyable piece called Timberline Tree, as a guitarist myself I sense this is a arrangement that we call, personal music therapy, this composition just seemed to be so organic and had just about everything you want from a guitar based album, there was something about this piece I felt was so deep, it was so moving and so personal to the artist himself.\nI have heard Bob Ardern and others in this genre play like this, but here Carleno seem to flow with the ease of silver, from a mirrored pool of musical delight. A traditional finger picking piece that I know will absolutely delight you and its called Childs Play\nAs Monty Python once said, now for something completely different and to be honest you couldn't get more different than Rhapsody in Blood. Think Hammer Horror films; think Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and Vincent Price and you will have it in one. Lets start my friends with wolves baying in the woods, let us start with the creaking sound of strings, like that old evil door.\nYou really have to listen to this composition to get the full benefit from it, but let me just say that Tom Carleno has brought you a movie styled piece of music here, that would fit superbly into any horror film you have ever watched, but BEWARE, the scream, it had my wife jump from her seat whilst she was editing another show to say to me, Did you hear a woman screaming outside?\nYes Rhapsody in Blood is really a fun piece to play, but I must say that Tom Carleno has not only done a good job here, but also enjoyed doing it, my only regret is he didn't ask me to add some audio  after the wolves, saying that old Dracula classic line Hark, can you hear them? The children of the night Wonderful track, you will love this.\nAlways room for a classic, many have done it recently, but here and rather appropriately, Carleno chooses Imagine by John Lennon, this is a song that for some reason people seem to play more at Christmas and here it sits at number nine on the album. Its respectfully played and one more song that you will want to sing along to.\nA little more time dear reader, to sample some of the perfection which we can now call Carlenos finger picking guitar on the piece Brief Encounter, before we fall into the lap of the last piece off the album called What A Difference A Day Makes. This is a gentle track to end with and in all honesty this is a delicious album and being an unbiased guitarist, I would recommend this to anyone, I would urge all guitarists to buy this, its has everything you might want to learn from, but more importantly everyone can enjoy a well performed album, produced and brought to us with such care and attention.\nAt times Carlenos style reminded me of Greg Lakes acoustic work on his days with Emerson Lake and Palmer, it has a little light and shade, it has a little night and day, and a little shadow and sunlight about it and this last piece almost confirms that.\nOverall Perfect Imperfection is the type of album that should get a lot of airplay from radio, it will do from ours and it should completely take the listeners imagination to a place that will be a most pleasurable location. Dont miss out on this album; its a rare gem that glows brightly in a world that seems to have lost its musical soul."
"11944","5","","B00GHG5524","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","Although he has recorded numerous times with his Denver-based acoustic jazz group Perpetual Motion, this is Tom's first release as a solo artist, and in the words of Crosby Stills and Nash: ""it's been a long time coming."" From the opening notes of the first track, ""In Search Of,"" it is obvious that Tom is an accomplished guitar instrumentalist. His intricate fingering is precise, yet fluid as it moves from one passage to another. I couldn't help but notice, not only in this composition, but characteristic of his playing in general, are the unusual chord changes and progressions he comes up with. I liked the occasional unpredictability of it and enjoyed not knowing where it might lead next. While most of the 11 songs on the album are originals, Tom does offer his take on a few cover tunes. The first is an intriguing version of Al Stewart's ""On The Border."" The original arrangement is an epic composition with vocals and full orchestration, so I was interested to hear how Tom would play it on solo guitar. But he did an admirable job, and I enjoyed hearing this familiar melody in a more elemental form.\n\nAnother cover song is one that I, and probably everyone on the planet, is familiar with - ""Imagine"" by John Lennon. Tom's gentle and respectful version captures the peace and love vibration that marked much of Lennon's writing. The last two compositions on the album, in a way, bookend Tom's career, highlighting past and present. ""A Brief Encounter,"" written in 1985, was his debut fingerstyle composition and is about first love and first heartache. The album comes to rest with a new song called ""What A Difference A Day Makes."" This is one of my favorite pieces on the album and has a meandering bucolic feel, like a Sunday drive on a country road - a sublime ending to this wonderful recording. There is no doubt that Tom Carleno is a masterful fingerstyle guitarist. His songwriting is innovative and often intriguing, full of unexpected twists and turns. ""Perfect Imperfection"" is perfectly wonderful instrumental guitar music."
"11945","5","","B00GHG5524","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Perfect Imperfection"" is the debut solo album by guitarist/composer Tom Carleno, but this is hardly the beginning of his music career. Carleno has been performing with his acoustic jazz ensemble, Perpetual Motion, for more than twenty-five years and has recorded five albums with them. ""Perfect Imperfection"" is a real showcase for Carlenos varied and passionate style of acoustic guitar playing and composing. A retrospective of eleven songs composed over the past twenty-five years and recorded over a four-year period, the pieces range from the serene Meet Me in Maui to covers of Al Stewarts On the Border and John Lennons Imagine to Childs Play, a spirited duet for guitar and spoons, and Rhapsody in Blood, Carlenos homage to the horror films of the 1930s and 40s - complete with sound effects! A master of his instrument, Carleno tells stories without words and paints vivid pictures without a canvas, sharing experiences and having fun in the process.\n\nThe album begins with In Search Of, a piece that Carleno says seemed to be trying to find its own way as he was writing it, sometimes going in different directions than he expected. Easy-going and relaxed, its a great opening. Meet Me in Maui is in memory of Carlenos mother, who also loved to vacation in Maui. Very tranquil and calming, it feels like a warm breeze blowing over a peaceful ocean. Beautiful! On the Border is one of Al Stewarts classic signature pieces. Originally released in 1976, Carlenos cover version is a great tribute to the British rocker! The graceful Timberline Tree was inspired by a painting by Carlenos mother, Joan Hagen Carleno. The piece is gorgeous, and a copy of the painting graces the back of the CD cover. I love Childs Play, a  playful and lighthearted duet for guitar and spoons (performed by Carlenos wife, Josie Quick). Rhapsody in Blood is a trip! Inspired by the spooky soundtracks for early horror films, this 6 1/2-minute tour de force includes some great sound effects, many (all???) of which were created on the guitar - creaking doors, howling wolves, bone-chilling screams, thunder, and other sounds of dark foreboding. From there, we go to the gentle simplicity of Lennons classic Imagine - an exceptionally nice arrangement! Brief Encounter was Carlenos first finger-style composition, written in 1985, and What a Difference a Day Makes is a lovely new piece composed specifically for this album.\n\n""Perfect Imperfection"" is a wonderful album that is excellent for focused listening as well as in the background. Well, Rhapsody in Blood isn't too good as background music, but the rest of the tunes are! Great stuff!"

As far as casual listeners, unaware of the conceptual specifics, are concerned, she wants to be a male. Past penis rumors suggest that might actually be the case.\n\nShe sounds like a female though. Unfortunately her voice is never laid atop any pleasurable melodies. The chorus, sang over bombastic synth sounds, is ironically weak.

She definitely needs to find better for her fans, and for her own self in voice. Her latest single, G.U.Y., the third single from Artpop really doesn't ignite or light up a fire the way her other songs had done before in her little monsters' hearts. I really didn't find the song to catch a fire the way people felt with Katy Perry's Roar and the songs that Beyonce' had shown like Drunk In Love.

Sadly, the quote of the name of the fame has drifted in the wind like her voice. Her music just hasn't worked for her like Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly. She just doesn't have that strike in the voice anymore in her songs. Her latest song G.U.Y., the third single from Artpop is trying to be more of a Madonna and Michael Jackson-esque sound, but sadly it doesn't have the interest at heart. Instead the song feels wasted and not worth the time. Maybe Lady Gaga should find herself a better G.U.Y. to be with her music than throw her voice away with.\n\nSong: D"

Never mind the fact that her self titled 3rd LP ""Debby Boone"" is, in my opinion, a pop vocal classic (""I'd Rather Be Alone"" is a classic in and of itself, but her version of ""Choosey Beggar"" is an alltime favorite of mine!) or that her country remakes showed a talent bigger than her one-hit-wonder status, Debby was the squeaky-clean religious daughter of Pat Boone and nothing was going to change that.  How sad she records so little and how sad we miss out on hearing more of those amazing vocals on a variety of genres.  We turned our backs, basically stating that nobody wanted to hear from her again.  Oh, how wrong we were.\n\nBut, lucky for us who have been paying attention, as Debby recorded music last year which is both fun, flashy and yeah, pretty darn fantastic.\n\nUptempo tunes show Debby's fun side, which (I think) few people think she has.  The most fun for me is ""Get Me To The Church On Time"", ""Sway"" and a jazzy/swinging version of ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"".  But once again it's Debby's voice on ballads such as ""Cry Me A River"" and ""More Than You Know"" that sets my heart a-flutter.  She's sounds as crystal clear and darn near perfect on these songs as she did 37 years ago, showing true talent endures through the ages.  Simply put: BEAUTIFUL!!\n\n(The only slight hic-cup for me is a version of ""Mack The Knife"", which in my opinion truly suits a males voice a bit better than a females.  So, it's more of a song choice than an issue with the vocal.  This song, however, no way effects the CD as a whole or it's well deserved 5 star rating.)\n\nNow, however, comes the painful task of waiting years upon years for another wonderful masterpiece from this talented singer.  Let's hope NOT!!!"

But in addition there is a pure flavor in songs like ""Be Careful It's My Heart"", and ""Round Midnight"". It is the charisma and feeling in Boones' voice that brings the listener to another place. She delivers these 14 songs with a personal style that comes from years of living some of these songs. I remember she sang ""That Old Black Magic"" in a huge medley on television a few years back - it is great to hear her voice re-visit it.  ""These Boots..."", ""I'm Gonna Live..."" and especially ""Mack The Knife"" show a sassy side of Boone that is endearing - listen to the delivery of the line ""did that boy do something rash?"" - she brings her theatre experience to these songs and they all benefit from it. The backing and production are excellent and the more uptempo arrangements are fun. Have a glass of wine and get away from it all!"

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."

Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails."

It is just so sad, because the more stunts she has pulled, or the more she is severely overplayed like Michael Jackson was, the more her songs are not worth listening to anymore. It is sad. Flawless has been one of those songs to where she is trying ti be more street than really rap alone, and tragically she has not been able to deliver around the voice alone. I personally found this song to be just as wasted as when she tried to deliver on rap with songs like Video Phone and Diva from her I Am... Sasha Fierce. Overall, if you are a die hard fan or new to Beyonce' Knowles music, I would suggest you pass this song up, and go to her songs when she was a part of Destiny's Child, or play Crazy In Love to death.\n\nSong: D-"

When I had heard she was going to pull out a ""surprise record"" back in 2013, I was honestly not interested in stunts without listening to the voice at heart. Sadly, she really did not push herself better into her own work for her self-titled Beyonce' record in 2013, she just instead overdid herself and fell apart at the seems. most of the tracks have really been poorly prepared, and shown no growth in her soul.

"12383","3","","B00HFWYKB6","d5bb6232c8a5d56117369443a640efc9WUN5","There is honestly so much that should be said better about Beyonce' Knowles, largely because she has been so severely overplayed, that the quality of her voice has passed on, and feels more jaded than a sense of joy listening to her. When she had came out with her surprise album in 2013, it felt more like a publicity stunt than a shocker, largely because she has not had the strong songs that have been worth it. Honestly, she did not take her time in her work, like the lackluster 4 album, which was more poorly made, than the sense she is a more built diva that has a voice, than a product. Her song Blue, from her self-titled album, was written in regards to the change in her life, becoming a new mother and having a new-found sense of a serenity. The song is one of her better ballads, but not really anything that is worth driving at the heart of the matter. Beyonce' Knowles needs to do better with her songs through the heart, largely because this song wasn't worth it.\n\nSong: C"

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those singers that has been more of a product than a real songstress. It is honestly very sad because she has made songs that have not really delivered, they have just been so overplayed like the manufactured voice at hand, not the songstress on the inside, unlike other divas that were worth something like Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole. When it came down to Ms. Knowles surprise album that she came out with in 2013, it actually has been more like a joke than a ""wow"" factor. Most of the songs have been more like jokes at hand, like Partition. She didn't feel like she igniting in the sex appeal, instead she felt more like a whimper overall. I really didn't like the song, and she really hasn't grown to be more of the diva at the absolute soul. Overall, if you are new to Beyonce's music, I would recommend passing his song up, and go to Crazy In Love, when she used to have a voice.\n\nSong: D"

Honestly when it has came to all the music from her surprise 5th album, she really had wasted a lot of peoples' time on the ears, and absolutely from the heart. I really found the music to be very tiresome, and unfortunately lagged a lot from her own heart. I found a lot of the collaborations from Drunk In Love, and Blow to be wasted. Superpower is another song that feels a bit more shady in her voice. She & Frank Ocean have absolutely no chemistry and just lags from her own drive. I really found the song to be one of her weakest songs from the album, and definitely not worth listening to. Frank has a little better work alone, but it definitely is not worth downloading the song alone. I think people have been so caught up in Drunk In Love, that this one was ""superpowered"" to a loss.\n\nSong: D"

It explodes like a bomb hitting the ground in one of those WWII aerial films - simultaneous heavy guitar, bass and cymbal crash. While the chord sustains, a few more bombs are seen falling beneath us, through a grey sky towards a black and white city below. Listen to the guitar at 0:07, this kind of hammered-on note an octave above the root. It is like the sudden moment of impact, with the waves of destruction rippling outward. Away to the west, tanks crawl slowly across farm fields, prepared to blow away anything in their way. At 0:31 a warning siren in a nearby town calls for everyone to evacuate.\n\nAt 0:52 the pace quickens with sharp stabbing chords and pulse-quickening hi-hat. Ozzy Osbourne begins to sing at 1:03:\n\nGenerals gathered in their masses\nJust like witches at black masses (or my preference, 'smell each other's stinky asses')\n\nI like the double meaning of 'mass'. Similar to 'please please me' by The Beatles. The rest of Geezer Butler's lyrics are good, and it's a great anti-war song but, you know what? I've never liked Ozzy's voice all that much. That's all I'm going to say about it.\n\nTony Iommi plays fantastic guitar throughout: those triplets at 1:29, the trill at 1:34, the descending chords at 1:48, the little bend at 1:50, the chug and slash part from 2:08-2:17 and the riffs that accompany Politicians hide themselves away. Beginning at 3:30 he plays several solos that overlap until around 4:20. I love those pitch bends from 4:13-4:18. A very clever guitarist.\n\nBill Ward plays excellent drum fills everywhere, particularly at 1:38, 1:52, 1:57, 2:02 and on and on, through Iommi's solo, and 5:28-5:30. Geezer Butler holds it all down with his mighty bass playing.\n\nThe final 2:12 is a section called 'Luke's Wall'. It's a pretty cool way to end the song. Some great drums in this part, too. And bonus for me: no Ozzy."

There is a lot of interesting trivia surrounding this group. For one thing, the group got its unusual name from none other than John Lennon of The Beatles? How did this happen? Well, The Cyrkle was the only American group managed by Fab Four manager Brian Epstein. In addition, the groups wildly successful debut single was co-written by Paul Simon (who was living in London at the time) and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers. This was before either Simon & Garfunkel or The Seekers became famous. Red Rubber Ball remains one of most popular singles of the 1960s. Short and sweet and wonderful!"

This song is the ultimate heart clincher, revenge seeking, and ultimate truth revealing (""so you'll come back to me"" line) song.  I'm thankful for this song and its mind reading lyrics. It still gets me snotty nosed every single time I hear it.  This song is a broken heart's soothing caress."

Her songs from her work with LaFace like Un-Break My Heart have ultimately withstood the test of time, but when word came out that Toni was going to collaborate with Babyface on a new set of songs, the question was would they be good? I Wish, the second single from their album Love, Marriage & Divorce isn't a bad ballad that shows the elegance of the piano through Toni's voice. While it does feel a bit corny through some of the lyrics of the songs, but nevertheless Toni does deliver through the song well through Babyface's piano playing. Still Toni is a much better singer than the idiots female singers of today like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, who have not shown beauty in voice through the song alone. This isn't a bad song as a wish that could be boldly granted.\n\nSong: B-"

However, both also do suffer from a hard flow that sometimes does not go over their beats well.\n\nJones' album suffers from an uneven flow, and his track beats are a little weak in my opinion. I was not eye-popped by any of the tracks on this album; they were all listenable and ok. The best of the bunch were Your City, Kingdom Figures and WOG, but Mouthpiece and Bizzle really bailed the first two songs out.\n\nOverall this project was ok. If you really like Christian Hip Hop, you can pick it up. Maybe it will sound better to you, like it did for these other reviewers. For me, I wasn't dissappointed, but I wasn't impressed either."

There has been so many poor songs from Rihanna and Beyonce' where the quality of the voice from the heart has died, and the feelings of the song isn't there. For Aloe Blacc to breakout in real soul, he showed that well when he released The Man earlier this year, but the big question is how can he follow-up such a great sampled song. His latest song, Love Is The Answer, the second single from his second album Lift Your Spirit, isn't as strong as was with The Man. His voice at times within the song sounds shallow and out of tune to the song. I was shocked, compared to his past songs like I Need A Dollar. It almost sounded like he needs to fine tune his heartstrings and find his heart again. Hopefully, there can be better songs from his down the road, that doesn't feel out of tune.\n\nSong: C 1/2-"

Of all the songs on that CD, this one stuck out the most.  It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.\n\nI've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future."

Actually it is more likely a metaphor for taking us listeners into new, unexplored dimensions of thought, not new territory for the expansionist thinker Kid Cudi. The album is enveloped in Cudi's deep, uninterrupted singing voice with one rapping verse inserted in the thick of the album. It is quite the experimental pop/rnb affair, hardly a hip hop album to be correct. Cudi is in typical form lamenting, crowing, and going on in that jazzy, stylistic way of his about his mental separation from society. When he is not singing and besides the one rapping verse on the album, large swaths of intergalactic instrumentals mellow out the proceedings. Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon definitely has Kid Cudi's patented musical vibe even if it cannot be classified or critiqued as a rap album. Within the genre that Cudi has invented for himself, whatever the name, the album is a respectable one."

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

It's the person you wouldn't want your daughter to become, and yet there seems to be more and more of them coming of age.  It's scary.\n\nAnd the fact that it's so scary from the standpoint of society, makes this song great in that makes a funny distraction out of it for three minutes.\n\nIt's only afterwards that you realize that each time you play it, another vanity-obsessed person is born."

He has had so many highs  and achievements that no singer will ever replicate & lows that could've derailed his life & career. But through it all, his legacy will always be beyond the yellow brick road. He has had so many bountiful generations come to him, and why he is still standing strong, where others like Michael Jackson & Prince died so young. You can listen to any of Elton's songs, and they still sound better than what is on radio right now. But nevertheless, the one album many people will always go to is his 1973 double-album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which bridged so many divides in the music industry. The title track, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just very timeless to listen to, produced by the dear Gus Dudgeon, as a timeless portrait of what a musician's soul is like when he finally meets his future and runs with it for a new light at the end of the tunnel. If you are new to Elton John's music, after all these generations or a very dear hard core fan, you'll absolutely want to go to this track as one of the first to listen to.\n\nSong: B+"

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, the namesake cut from its album, is not only a fine tune in its own right but is one of the best hits to come out of the 1970s. Many critics consider this gold blockbuster to be Elton John's finest song. It is an amazing song but in my opinion, Elton John did a number of hits equally as good. Nevertheless, this is an essential hit sung in ballad form."

It's about the hobbits wanting to enjoy some elevensies, you know, have a little snack after traveling so far.'\n\nThis is also one of their Light and Shade songs, featuring gentle acoustic guitars giving way to heavy electric guitars.\n\nSomething like that. Ramble On is also one of your Robert Plant double tracked vocal songs. You can hear it mostly at the end, it's like there are two Roberts singing, separate but equal. You can also hear this phenomenon in songs like Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and Whole Lotta Love."

Listen to ""The Swallow Tail Jig"" in Digital music and ""This Kiss"" here and see if you think so too. The talent in making the music enhance the cinematography and action scenes is a unique talent that few composers achieve with such emotion and grandeur.

That being said, after first listen I was disheartened.  However, after repeated listens, it's quickly grown on me!.\n\nThere are many great songs on 48:13: Eez-Eh, Stevie, Bumblebee, Treat, Bow.  I do feel these would have been great-ER had Serge, the creative mastermind behind Kasabian, who also took on the role of Producer for 48:13, done less production work with dubbing, overdubbing & electronics. Both Tom's (lead singer) & Serge's (backing & some lead) vocals are in fine form.  The lyrics are a bit repetitive.  Serge is definitely flexing his creative ""muscles"" on 48:13 & I have to believe that's a good thing which will continue to carry Kasabian forward rather than repeating themselves.  It is definitely more electronic than earlier releases, but it does work after all!  Just don't be anticipating another West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum or Velociraptor and if you don't discount it after the first full listen, you'll probably grow to appreciate it very quickly.  Kasabian don't usually release the same sounds twice; 48:13 just goes a little further ""left of the dial""!!  I'd strongly recommend going for the 48:13 Deluxe version which comes with a bonus live DVD because Kasabian live are always a ""Treat""!!!  (PLAYABLE ON US PLAYERS!..UPC Code 88843063776.)"

First I'd like to talk about the title track which has a mesmerizing quality to it. Loved, loved the bell like tone of the piano, cello and violins in counterpoint. An unusual combination for sure, with a haunting melody to match, this is purity of music at its very zenith :-) The stateliness of ""Dines Waltz"" is sublime number with a very very calming influence on the mind. ""Faith"" with its English horn, violin, flute is an inventive melody with fantastic performances by the musicians all around. ""So Much To Say"" has a pensive feel to it and is perfect for the times when one wants to think quietly with no distractions :-) I absolutely loved the little flourishes Calandra produces on the piano in "" A Quiet Spark"". This is a lovely composition, brilliantly performed :-) Another track I want to mention here is ""The Dreamer"". What a track! It just transported me to a land of gorgeous soundscapes. Magnificent keyboard tones, and the violin solo was breathtaking. This album is so much more than just a collection of beautiful tracks, its music composition at its best! :-)"
"13540","5","","B00JI68EGE","0378d42d2af1f922ba0963cc1cf68c26YZYF","Peter Calandra's latest album is an engaging collection of thirteen original compositions that encompass a dynamic mix of jazz, new age, and fusion.\n\nThe electric/acoustic keyboardist is joined on this outing by Joy Askew on vocals, Tom Barney on acoustic bass, Ralph Farris on viola and violin, Kathy Halvorson on oboe, Kathleen Nester on flute and piccolo, Peter Prosser on cello, and Stomu Takeishi on fretless electric bass.\n\nEvery track on this disc is captivating, thanks not only to Calandra's inventiveness as a composer but also his skill as a performer and his professionalism as a bandleader. He and his studio mates enjoy a musical rapport that is evident in the infectiousness of the tunes.\n\nFlawless from beginning to end, this CD delivers the goods."
"13541","5","","B00JI68EGE","8927944f9170620db16f51af1f812a64OSYP","Peter Calandra's ""Inner Circle"" is an excellent instrumental CD.  My very favorite track is ""The Wayfarer"" with its delightful rhythms that build, suddenly soften and then explode with lush excitement.  ""Faith"" is another great track.  Calandra seems to like abrupt shifts in his music, from the throbbing to the contemplative and back again.  As a musical construction, ""Faith"" has similarities to ""The Wayfarer"" & is another gem.  ""Dine's Waltz"" is a lovely piano melody with synthesizer textures for context.  The CD's opening track ""Clyde & the Pearl"" brings the listener in with the cymbals percussion and the lovely keyboard themes.  The CD concludes with ""Chorale"" which feels like a devotional piece.  This set is strong from start to finish.  Enjoy!"
"13542","5","","B00JI68EGE","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Inner Circle"" is a fascinating collection of thirteen original pieces by Peter Calandra, a composer best-known for his scoring for film and television. Piano and keyboards are prominent in all of these pieces, and Calandra is backed by an impressive list of guest musicians on an assortment of instruments. I think the most remarkable thing about this album is that Calandra is so comfortable with and adept at such a broad spectrum of musical styles that range from classical to jazz to pop and fusion. Calandra's goal with ""Inner Circle"" was ""to touch the listener's heart, to strike an emotional chord, while also exploring my wide-ranging musical interests."" Mission accomplished! ""Inner Circle"" is Calandra's fifth independent release, and should bring him out of the background and into the spotlight. In addition to his soundtrack work, he has also played keyboard for an impressive list of Broadway productions and has music published and playing in sixty countries around the world. He has also played and recorded with the New York Pops Orchestra and artists that include Dee Dee Bridgewater, Aretha Franklin, and Allen Ginsberg.\n\n""Inner Circle"" begins with the intriguingly-titled ""Clyde And The Pearl,"" a jazzy confection that features Calandra on percussion, keyboards, and piano. Upbeat, rhythmic, and very catchy, it's a great opener! ""Dine's Waltz"" goes in a different direction with a light and very graceful dance for piano and strings. The first movement of ""The Wayfarer"" reminds me a bit of early Yanni with darkly intense strings and a powerful pulse that evolve into a sweet interlude that returns to a variation on the original theme, adding haunting, passionate vocals - one of my favorites! ""Better Angels"" is an evocative piano solo that relies on deep emotion rather than fancy finger-work to convey its message. The title track begins as a duet that mixes a sparkling keyboard with silky-smooth strings - very beautiful. ""Faith"" is another favorite. It begins as a soulful duet for oboe and piano and easily transitions into a chamber work by adding violin, cello, acoustic bass and flute. Themes are alternately serene and more energetic, building intensity all the way to the end. From there, we go to a sweet and tender piano solo called ""So Much To Say."" To show he still hasn't run out of new directions to take his listeners, ""A Quiet Spark"" is a gently ambient piano solo that comes directly from the heart. ""The Dreamer"" is atmospheric and hypnotic with a single low tone that runs through the whole piece along with keyboard and strings that cast a peaceful, magical spell. The last track is another surprise called ""Chorale,"" which pretty much says it all. Joy Askew overdubbed multiple vocal tracks, singing soprano, alto, and tenor parts and bringing the album to a close with an elegant wordless hymn.\n\nDespite the varied styles of music on this album, it holds together really well and takes the listener on an aural journey. Recommended!"

From the opening track beginning with the cello and violins, the mood is passionate and longing, but then it changes over to powerful rhythm of drums and a male and female choir with a dramatic theme like a mighty army coming closer to its target.  Then, the music and the voices abruptly stop and you hear the echoes die in the spaciousness of what I picture as vaulted ceilings.  This music could well be used for a battle scene with intermittent cut scenes going back and forth with the main character remembering the person that he left behind.  This is the first soundtrack that I have bought from Audiomachine, and it will probably not be my last.  They know what they are doing, and they have truly produced some epic music on this album.  Some of the composers that Paul Dinletir and Kevin Rix like are Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy, Hans Zimmer, and Harry Gragson-Williams which are composers I like as well.  One of the elements that I think makes music great is the phrasing of the themes that the composer comes up with and the variations of the themes that they make after they have stated the main theme.  Another element that I believe makes music great is not just the notes, but the silence between the notes.  Claude Debussy stated, ""Music is the silence between the notes,"" and J. Krishnamurti stated, ""Listen both to the sound of the bell and to the silence between it's strokes.""  I like the phrasing that the composers have used of silence in their music, and they have created some great music.  As a case in point, take Track 2 with the beginning string's and the two-beat base, and they then add the theme with a female voice that hauntingly goes above this background rhythm like a crow flying over a desolate forest and landscape.  To strengthen the theme, the composers then use trumpets and horns to bring the theme more power and strength.  Then, unlike the first track, the composers do not go completely silent, but have about 4 measures with only the two-beat base going.  After that break, the music comes back with a heroic feeling of determination, like an army fighting against powerful odds.  I love piano music, and to me, it is like a violin, bringing out feelings of love and tenderness.  Track 3 starts out with just the piano playing a theme that denotes sadness, like someone may have just died, but soon it is joined by base, cello, and drums.  After this, a female voice begins the lament; powerful drums with a driving beat then pick up the pace.  Then, the musical journey begins over mountains, fording rivers, through dark valleys to reach the end of their quest for peace and some kind of meaning out of the sorrows of life.  I will not go through each track for music is meant to be listened to and felt, more than described and analyzed.  Each tack is wonderful to listen to, and it transports you wherever you let your imagination go.  Enjoy!"

Honest without sacrificing the message of Christ. The album is diverse in songs, though primarily targeted for the inner city. His imagery is clear enough so that if you didn't grow up in the hood you'll be gripped. He's versatile, crunk, laid back, romance, the struggle, repentance and deliverance are all covered.

Ultimately the decision was made that Hank would sing the song and ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" was released as the""B"" side of ""My Bucket's Got A Hole In It"" in February 1949. C&W deejays discovered the song anyway and it quickly became a favorite on Country radio and a staple of Hank's ""live"" shows. Still a large segment of the record-buying public remained unfamiliar with the tune. That all changed in 1966 when a young pop-country singer from Texas named B.J. Thomas re-imagined the song for mid-60's pop audiences. ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" by B.J. Thomas and the Triumphs would race all the way to #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April of that year. For my money this continues to be most moving version of this song ever recorded.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio."

Jazmine Sullivan has been one of those singers who has honestly been unappreciated and overlooked with having great songs and honestly her music has shown some highs that brought out the best in her voice. But honestly, she also has had some songs that just really have been a miss in her work from the heart. Her lead single from her album Reality Show, Dumb, isn't actually one of her better songs.  I really think the song isn't actually one of her good songs, but the video of puppets and humans having affairs and make-outs is honestly one of the creepiest videos I had ever seen. I really hope Jazmine Sullivan has good music with Reality Show coming out, but this song is honestly a must have for your music library.\n\nSong: D"

The second track, ""The Sphere,"" opens with lulling guitars and a lovely string tune and washes you joyfully with keyboards as if you are traveling in the clouds with different sonic thoughts coming and going in flight.  The title track begins with rain & thunder sounds before guitar & keyboards float seamlessly.  ""Away"" is a gentle track with chimes and guitar that transport us to a dreamlike wistful place.  ""Inland Returned"" is a lovely track that starts as a little guitar melody and seems to transform into a minuet with flutes and fanciful percussion.  The set concludes with one of its strongest melodies on ""With You"" that has some punchy percussion and brings this journey to a close.  John Luttrell's ""The Dream Exchange"" is an excellent instrumental disc.  Enjoy!"

The notes sit so well over the textures, atmospheric layers on The Sphere and Orange sky... remarkable use of effects. On gossamer wings is truly like a web... delicate and woven so intricately with a very neat feel. The chords, arpeggios and harmonics through Interstellar dust add so much substance to the arrangement, as with 12-string guitar and airy sound effects on Somnambulistic Journey."
"13863","5","4","B00K4H9JMO","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","With one of the cutest and most appealing album covers Ive seen in awhile, John Luttrells ""The Dream Exchange"" grabs your attention, piques your interest, and then soothes your stresses and worries away with close to an hour of warm, optimistic music that works seamlessly in the background or as music that flows in and out of close listening attention. Calling his music atmospheric music takes it in a somewhat different direction from new age or ambient because its both and yet neither from a purist standpoint. With elements of prog rock, the album features Luttrell on acoustic and electric guitars as well as keyboards with twelve songs that follow the theme of exchanging dreams. In the liner notes, Luttrell explains: Throughout our lives we share our dreams with family and friends, and they share their dreams with us. If we're lucky we can help them activate and achieve their dreams and also work on achieving our own. How wonderful it is to experience and share in this Dream Exchange. A lifelong musician who has lived and absorbed cultural influences from all over the world, Luttrells music reflects many of these influences and gives him a very distinctive sound.\n\n""The Dream Exchange"" begins with Orange Sky, a piece that combines dreamy atmospheric sounds with a gently-floating guitar melody and a lively rhythm that comes and goes - a very effective opening! The Sphere contains a variety of styles and is possibly one of the more prog rock pieces. From Hawaiian guitar to electric rock guitar over ambient musical and atmospheric sounds, it has no hard edges while continuously evolving as it develops. Dreamcast is a favorite. Slow and graceful with a shimmering beauty, it reminds me of watching a sunset by the ocean. The title track opens with the sound of rain and thunder and then the electric guitar enters, evoking images of the sun breaking through the storm clouds. From there, guitars express tones of peaceful calm and tranquility - also a favorite. I love the title Somnambulistic Journey, and the misty, dreamy music is the perfect accompaniment to a peaceful sleepwalking expedition. Ethereal Raga combines a catchy rhythm and mysterious ambient sounds to create colorful images that dance slowly in atmospheric clouds - fascinating! Inland Returned is light and fanciful with acoustic and electric guitars leading the way with a gentle smile. With You brings the album to a close with an easy, swaying rhythm and feelings of blissful contentment.\n\n""The Dream Exchange"" is quiet, relaxing music with plenty of substance to hold your interest while letting your imagination fly. Recommended!"

I don't mind Brantley Gilbert making a song about the undeserved death of a soldier, since most of his material released as singles is either mediocre or absolutely horrible (I give 'Bottoms Up' credit for at least being catchy even though there are things about it that I don't like), but trying to express the emotion of th death of a loved one in a song, and then using the most trite, horrid, and annoying high-pitched guitar solos all over the song make the person the song is about ashamed. In fact, this is worse than what Gilbert has put out with any of his other singles. At least songs like 'Read Me My Rights' & 'Stone Cold Sober' show that Gilbert is making music correctly even though the instrumental elements of the songs may not be done well.\n\nBut, when Radio Stations fumble with what gets played on the radio, and then choose a very annoying and terrible song to play, thats what should be abolished for eternity.  Even worse is when they play a bad song ad nauseum, you predict they probably won't play a song that much to elavate your anger, but they do anyway, no matter how you feel about the song, and it never stops until you start hating the song with a passion, and THEN they start to cool down with that song. Instead of just stopping with the song right when you feel like they need to stop. That is a method in radio, not just country, that needs to be abolished from reality for eternity.\n\nWe need a Brantley Gilbert song that isn't so boring, bland, trite, or not what you want to repeat on Spotify. His new single isn't helping because besides the country pop and rock stuff that you saw in 'Bottoms Up', Gilbert ends up using some of the worst cliches and overused phrases. Instead of thinking to yourself 'Finally, a song from this guy I can actually tolerate beyond chart movement', its always the same feelings about a whole new song all over again.\n\nSo overall, listen to Toby Keiths 'Ameican Soldier' instead of this stupid Def Leppard, Guns N Roses country garbage with lyrics."

Jana Kramer.\n\nWell, i never heard of her before this (Media, always keeping young-uns from the public). And man, what a shame.... what shame, because this song is so beautiful and has a feeling of reaching. Like searching and knowing that the treasure is just around the corner. Kind of like at the end of Thor (the movie) when everything has happened and the last line, ""She searches for you..."" Oh my gosh.  One of the best kinds of ""epic"" ever...\n\nLove is about searching for it. Searching for love and where it may be hiding. We always feel heart break, and imposters always come our way.... but we keep searching, knowing it will just be around the corner. That hope pushes us forward. Like an adventure.\nAnd that's what this song sounds like. An adventure right on the border between sad and hopeful. Jana Kramer sounds amazing. The lyrics are fantastic (though the beginning may or may not be cringeworthy). The beat and the melody is beautiful. And the feeling it gives you is the same feeling i experienced at the end of Thor. ""She searches for you...""\n\nIncredible. Buy it. Lord-willing, this artist will put out more music like this."

They are at the core of the culture's goals alongside having a good time, challenging popular thought, and expressing oneself artistically and creatively. Already well experienced in the rap game, Queens, New York emcee Cormega makes effective use of his time by employing these principles in Mega Philosophy, a collaboration album with the legendary Large Professor serving as producer. Cormega is by far more mature than he has ever been. He stresses many points including achieving inner peace through questioning, keeping an open mind, persevering, and taking personal responsibility. In fact the whole album revolves around the theme of maintaining a strong mental state, which is the secret to life. Cormega's smooth flow of intelligent rhymes coupled with the Large Professor's no-frills beats make for classical hip hop listening, and the guest emcees, Redman, AZ, Styles P, Nature, Raekwon, and Black Rob, all contribute very hot, very smart verses. If Mega seems to get redundant, he is only paraphrasing, putting his lessons in other words to get through to his listeners; thus, he never gets dull. Driving his points home in a little more than thirty minutes, he is also concise with no fluff or fillers. Cormega and the Large Professor have not invented any groundbreaking formulas but instead simply combine their talents to make good, authentic hip hop for what might be one of the year's best rap albums."

Unfortunately, Mariah Carey had really lost her own heart and soul on her own work for the past several years, and her own career has faded into the wind. With the failure of Me... I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse, she really has not been able to ignite  a flame she used to have back in the 90's, and her work with The Emancipation Of Mimi. But the songs she had came out with from her last few records, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, and this one sincerely haven't been worth it. Thirsty, is one of those songs that really does not even have the heart to deliver. It might be fine just for one listen, but for Mariah Carey, it really is not one of her own best songs. She honestly has made some bad choices, and I think it is time for Mariah to retire from her own career and worth. Her own thirst has dried up.\n\nSong: C-"

Mariah Carey had so much talent in the 90's and in the 2000 decade when she released The Emancipation of Mimi, but these days the talent has been more wasted in heart. The music on her most recent album Me I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse has been more of a waste of time, and far departure considering the end of her own marriage to Nick Cannon, and the lack of drive in her recent works. Thirsty, the lead single from the album is absolutely one of her worst songs she has recorded in years. It is definitely a lack of time that she couldn't electrify in her own soul, and lags what she showed in songs like We Belong Together and It's Like That. She honestly lagged a real rhythm from her own heart and the upbeat songs she used to deliver, makes me want to go to her earlier works, when her voice was strong and when she used to have talent. I would definitely pass this song up.\n\nSong: D-"

It has been a very long while since she came out with new songs. The past few years set the motion of her music failing and more about her feuds between Nicki Minaj, and the decision of firing her as a judge on American Idol. Her latest set of songs, do fail to ignite on her new record Me... I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse. Thirsty, the next single from wasted album shows that Mariah still is missing the mark at heart and in voice as well. I really found the song to be even worse than even all the songs she had released from her last album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel. She definitely needs to find better in her voice, and her heart. Hopefully, there will be better from her to quench your thirst in her voice.\n\nSong: D+"

I have also heard a version by Tom Jones before on one of his greatest hits collection.

Blige, she has had some really great songs, and others that haven't been able to hit the nail on the head. The songs that she had made over the years have been both hit and miss. Twenty years ago, she was able to hit the nail on the head with having a song hit big from the movies, with Not Goin' Cry from Waiting To Exhale back in 1995. The song really was a great song. But her latest set of songs, honestly aren't as good as what she had before. Suitcase, the lead single from the Think Like A Man Too soundtrack, isn't exactly as a saying, ""I am leaving you,"" song, as strong as some of her other songs had shown before. Hopefully, there will be better songs from Mary down the road, because this song really was a waste from the heart, and that is saying pack it up and get away from this song.\n\nSong: C"

However, this album is very beautiful and adds to the eclectic music of TSFH. I want to point out that Thomas Bergersen composed this entire album but it was released as a TSFH album since many of these songs were released on previous industry albums. I would not recommend buying this if you are new to TSFH as it does not represent what they are most famous for. However, I would recommend buying this if you prefer softer pieces and songs that almost sound like pop music (I think Thomas created a new genre of music with this album - ""epic pop"", listen to ""My Freedom"" and you'll see what I mean), or if you have everything else from TSFH and want more. This is definitely a must if you are a diehard TSFH fan. If you are new to TSFH I would recommend Battlecry, Vanquish, Illusions, or Sun. The former two if you want epic courageous music, and the latter two if you primarily want epic emotional/beautiful music.\nHighlights of this album include: Miracles, Compass (especially the bonus track), My Freedom, Fountain of Life, Color the Sky, Breath of Cold Air, Wind Queen, Lost in Las Vegas."

They include Big Beethoven Box, Big Handel Oratorio Box, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music to my digital library. This album is very good. It features over four hours of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music, including all of his Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites, as well as several concertos. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I don't think it quite rises to the level of the finest albums of Bachs orchestral music, many of which I also own. (Those include: Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites by Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert; Keyboard Concertos by Murray Perahia and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; and Oboe Concertos by Christian Hommel and the Cologne Chamber Orchestra.)\n\nThe performances found on Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music appear to date from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate a very high degree of artistry and musicianship. However, these performances seem (to my ears, anyway) to lack some of the driving tempos and pungency found in later historically informed performances of Bachs music that I prefer. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings, the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well balanced.\n\nDespite my minor concerns about Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music I still think it is a good sampler of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music. With its excellent performances, well-rounded musical selections, and good audio quality, and with its low price of 99 cents, I can easily recommend this album."

In this considerable gap of time, the guys have kept busy doing various, individual side albums, collaborations, and other projects. Apparently the timeout must have inspired member appreciation of how valuable their combined chemistry really is because this 2014 Directors Of Photography album ranks equally with any one of their previous albums, which set a more ambitious standard for conscious hip hop with each consecutive release. The hallowed LA triumvirate are essentially back to their specialty, kicking tight, crafty hip hop rhymes and lyrics over elegant, soulful beats that are expertly put together, samples included. Fans can look forward to more life lessons on which to ponder and more unique attitudes, opinions, perspectives and philosophies to consider. In addition to the mental, metaphysical goodies on the album, Rakaa and Evidence also dabble in some tough-talk rapping, which means they believe in what they're saying, they are not speaking on some loose whim, and they can back up their words with strong reasoning. Every track on the album is a gem, but a few really stand out. ""Show Me The Way"" sounds like it could be a radio song. It's motivational, and it's got a great beat, a great hook, and great lyrics behind it. ""Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)"" is notable for its screwed, scratched beat, which sounds like the old East Coast-influenced West meets DJ Screw's Houston, a great hip hop cut. The gang are not without worldly awareness in ""Century Of The Self"" where they analyze the corrupt, selfish tendencies of human nature on earth. The Dilated Peoples have always been proponents of building mentally and expanding minds. They have always come original and never copied trends or tried to be something other than themselves. Directors Of Photography is all those things at once, and as a result, everyone wins."

Levine is the experienced pop star, and he sells the song\nbetter, especially with the all-out ending.  But Keira (in her first real singing job) conveys a lot of emotion with her soft, breathy voice.  Ultimately,\nthe song is just short of a classic due to a few weak lines that don't fit well.

All the songs have strong lyrics and melodies.  But both the aforementioned are borderline-\noverproduced.

Featuring the Barchet Quartet, this is a very good MP3 album that contains over 10 hours of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts string quartets and quintets, all very artistically performed.\n\nThis MP3 VoxBox Edition contains all 23 of the string quartets in Mozarts oeuvre, plus all 6 of the string quintets he also composed. The works are placed in chronological order by their assigned K&ouml;chel (K) number, quartets first, followed by quintets. This allows listeners to hear the progression of Mozarts musical thinking and development over the years of composing in this genre.  Without question, each of these chamber works is a Mozartean masterpiece.\n\nThe Barchet Quartet was a German ensemble founded by violinist Reinhold Barchet. Other members of the ensemble were violinist Will Beh, violist Hermann Hirschfelder, and cellist Helmut Reimann. Violist Emil Kessinger joined the Barchets as a second viola for the string quintets. The musicianship of these players is generally excellent, although on occasion the violins sound a trifle over-bright, and display a bit more vibrato than my ears prefer. The audio quality is certainly crisp, clean, and precise, but the recordings thin string timbre and lack of fine detail make it obvious that these are older recordings that date from the 1950s and 1960s. However, this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Mozart: The Complete String Quartets and Quintets first came out at Amazon.com in 2014, it apparently sold for 99 cents  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at nearly ten times that price ($9.49) I think it remains an excellent classical music value. With its low price, very fine performances, and good audio quality, it is certainly recommendable for any digital music library."
"14547","5","2","B00LPQGCM8","34ff51769d88e6e955efd6544f3feae5JYU4","These recordings are of fine, traditional German performances of Mozart, ca. 1955-1958. I admired these on Lp and the sound quality -- although variable from performance to performance -- basically has held up well. For $0.99, this collection is a steal, but don't expect the virtuosity of more modern string quartets like the Alban Berg or Hagen or Emerson. As compensation, the playing is consistently warm-hearted. Think Bruno Walter's late recordings on Sony or Josef Krips and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra for similar approaches to Mozart's symphonic works."

Considered the leading doom metal band all across the globe, Electric Wizard carefully crafted another reminder that they have no intention whatsoever of relinquishing their throne.  My first Electric Wizard album was ""Black Masses,"" which I love for its heavy Black Sabbath influences (and who happen to be one of my all-time favorite bands), but ""Time to Die"" is another beast in itself.  Other reviewers have compared it to ""Dopethrone,"" which I have not yet heard, but this album is MUCH heavier than ""Black Masses.""\n\nIn fact, the album is so heavy that the guitar, bass, and drums can be a little overwhelming.  The lyrics on several songs are practically indecipherable and wind up sounding like witches chanting (in a good way).  With the exception of ""Destroy Those Who Love God,"" ""SadioWitch,"" and ""Saturn Dethroned,"" every song on this album is either close to or over 10 minutes in length, which is enough to loosen even the sturdiest of brains.  And of course the band lays on the Satanic schtick, adding audio clips involving cult killings and the like throughout the album.\n\n""I Am Nothing,"" ""We Love the Dead,"" ""SadioWitch,"" and ""Lucifer's Slaves"" are my personal favorite tracks, but you can't treat this the same way you would another album.  Listening to Electric Wizard is, in and of itself, a completely different experience than just simply listening to your average album.  Sometimes it requires dimming the lights, lighting some candles, burning some insence...you get the idea.  Now enjoy!"

Ghost is also a song that draws a listener in because she is singing about someone who has left an impact on her and is singing about her though process of trying to figure out how to best deal with it. Henderson also carefully projects her voice during the song in a way that conveys she is really putting all of her spirit and emotion to the song.  Ghost by Ella is great for those who are open to listening to pop songs with hints of R&B and synth-pop."

Their style of sludge metal/stoner rock is very similar, though they have a much more serious edge to their lyrics.  They've described their music as being for head-thinkers as well as head-bangers, and I would wholeheartedly agree.  There is a level of social commentary to their lyrics that cannot be ignored, and it serves them well.\n\nWhat we have here are three acoustic versions of songs available on two of their full-length albums, ""Murder the Mountains"" and ""Whales and Leeches.""  Following the acoustic versions are the original album versions, provided perhaps in an attempt to establish greater contrast between the two versions.  Either way, these songs kick some serious ass.\n\nThe session starts with ""Failure,"" which can be found on the band's most recent album, ""Whales and Leeches.""  The two songs that follow--""Human Herd"" and ""Malverde""--can be found on their sophomore album, ""Murder the Mountains.""  Both albums are available on Relapse Records, and I strongly recommend you check out this free EP if you're at all interested in the music of Red Fang."

Jimmy Page called it ""waking up the army of guitars."" It also prevents Robert Plant from sneaking up on us - we are ready when his voice bursts out of the speakers. The song is about a lustful old black Labrador Retriever that lived near Headley Grange during the recording sessions.\n\nThe precision of the music is indeed reminiscent of a military close-order drill. The main riff, written by John Paul Jones, represents the guitar army, layers of them, marching together, inspiring awe and respect. They even create a brass timbre somehow, at least to my ears. The call and response pattern lasts until 0:42, when the riff gets twisted up and discombobulated before righting itself at 0:52 as we head into the oh yeah break. Jimmy plays some nifty descending runs and we head into the second verse: I gotta roll can't stand still got a flamin heart can't get my fill.\n\nAt 1:27 we get a calming set of ah ah ah etc from Robert, but then at 1:38 John Bonham's drums explode with awesome power. This is a tremendously exciting moment, one of my favorites of any song. The levels are perfect: attack, loudness, reverb, emotional effect. Whoa. It takes us into another new part, the hey baby whoa baby I-don't-wear-pants-and-I'm-a-lecherous-black-dog part. This goes on until 2:04.\n\nThe song cycles back through the basic layout once more, adding a sweet guitar double helix at 3:07. Finally, at 3:37, the general of the guitar army proudly shows off the skills of improvised battle strategy, as the troops continue their parade with no signs of tiring."

The (erstwhile?) member of the great Be Good Tanyas has been quite active since the Be Good Tanyas went on (forever?) hiatus in 2007. Ford issued a well-received solo album in 2010 with ""Obadiah' and the followed that up with this album in 2014.\n\n""Indian Ocean"" (11 tracks including the ""hidden"" bonus track; 47 min.)  opens with ""September Fields"", about as accessible as anything Ford has done before. Immediately apparent in the sound are the warm horns. Turns out this is non other than the legendary Hi Rhythm Section, holy cow! Things slow down a bit on ""You're Free"". The album has a pretty nice overall R&B feel to it, check out ""Done"" (1st radio single) as a great example. Side B opens with the deceptively slow ""You Got Religion"". Another highlight deeper into the album is the hard-charging ""Natural Law"". But it all leads to the epic (and album-closing) title track, a 6+ min. journey (with observations like ""You come again and again/And you, you're sorry/You're sorry/For what you've done""). The ""hidden track ""September Fields"" is an acoustic version of the album's opening song, just Frazey and her guitar. Bottom line: this is a delightful album on many levels. I have no idea whether the Be Good Tanyas will ever come together again, but it's clear that Frazey Ford has found her own path and voice.\n\nJust this past weekend I saw Frazey Ford in concert at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Fest here in Ohio. Ford and her band played an hour long set in the late afternoon on the main stage, and the crowd absolutely loved her. She played mostly from ""Indian Ocean"" but also a couple of tunes that I didn't recognize and am quite certain these are new songs. Given that it took her 4 years between the first and second solo album, here's hoping we'll get a new album next year (at the latest!). If you have a chance to see Frazey Ford live, don't miss her!"

The proficient, dexterous youngster, Bishop Nehru, who aside from emceeing and producing has tried his hand at music video editing and directing, has learned, adapted and shined through with the tools that the experienced emcee/producer MF Doom has handed him. Their collaborative album, NehruvianDOOM, blends crafty lyrics from Nehru, eclectically made beats by Doom, and an optimistic tone from the two artists combined. Considering his youth and scant years in the industry, Bishop Nehru surprisingly has a very clear, confident perspective on life, an unclouded vision, and a maturity that surpasses his years. In the face of others' jealousy and envy, he lays out his philosophy with strength in his delivery. Although Bishop Nehru mentions having to adjust to a dog eat dog world on ""Caskets"" (MF Doom provides a rap verse on that song), he counters this stark tone with words of love on ""Mean The Most."" Ultimately, NehruvianDOOM would not sound as unique as it does if not for MF Doom's multifaceted production skills. Doom layers light and heavy sounds on top of each other and characteristically inserts obscure sound bytes to reinforce the album's mission. Bishop Nehru embraces his youth for the time being, but he also proves to be a threatening contender to his emcee peers. The youthful smarts in Nehru's skillful lyrics plus Doom's very special beats make NehruvianDOOM a fresh, underground treat."

Check out the Mummy music and see if you hear it too. I also hear shades of the Marvel comics-page flipping theme. This score was otherwise flat and forgettable. Sure, it matched the bombastic explosions and CGI sensory overload of the film but doesn't work isolated."
"14712","4","","B00M7I4OLO","59b64701e6eeebec48e19e2d829f72b8HIL2","The heroes in a half shell have had a long and prosperous life in film and television. Im one of the millions of kids who grew up with the original trilogy. I ran around with chopsticks taped to my back as you do when you're 4, pretending to be a ninja turtle. The turtles have been revamped before, and not too long ago hit theaters as an animated feature. The great thing about this ever-lasting franchise is that they have no musical identity (maybe the original TV theme song and Vanilla Ice sadly) so it becomes an open canvas for a composer. I mean, how many of you remember John Du Prezs scores for the original trilogy? Or even Klaus Badelts awesome score for TMNT in 2007? The scores worked in the moment, but never became attached to these characters, and this allowed for Tyler to build a simply damn awesome orchestral action score from scratch.\n\nBrian Tyler reunites with director Jonathan Liebesman for their fourth feature together here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is simply just a fantastic orchestral approach to the typical summer studio tentpole. Everything about this score moves with fluidity, intensity, awe and a warm heroic glow. A simple theme acts as the lifeline of the score. It carries the weight of the films much larger action scope with ease. It can turn one way and feel heavy and dramatic, but it can also flip to be uplifting and heroic. Tyler affectionately refers to it as the TMNT March. The whole score is nothing really complicated, it propels the action and gives it an old school adventure vibe. Parts of it reminded me of Jerry Goldsmiths The Mummy, it had that kind of adventure spirit. Some parts also reminded me of Hans Zimmers Man Of Steel, mostly Zimmers main theme and the track Terraforming. Tylers action writing is not too different from Zimmer though, they do approach things similarly which is fun because their stylistic approaches are very different. Even if there was a little case of temp track hangover, Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is its own fun ride. Its melodically charged and gives the film a big adrenaline rush without being contrived or unnecessarily loud. The flow of the adventure is so smooth, and with long tracks you get a feel for the scores structure. The theme is used a lot, but I never got a one-note type feel. The only thing lacking is some emotional and structural depth.\n\nBrian Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is all types of fun. Its a great action score done in that great orchestral fashion that Tyler is known for. A simple theme holds the dramatic weight of the film, plus adds heroic flare. You won't find deep emotions or anything much beyond the main theme, but thats all the score needs to do here. There are plenty of great moments, superb action builds and the music flows with ease. The score delivers all that you need in order to watch this incarnation of the turtles fighting the baddies in an action extravaganza.\n\nKaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.com"

In the album, he deals with how he has evolved with hip hop over the years, his having to overcome obstacles in and out of the music business, and even his recent weight loss and lifestyle change to increased physical fitness. Joell Ortiz is obviously in a healthy place in life, considering the fact that he is performing this self examination with a grateful attitude. He is still that creative, hard edged emcee who raps with advanced lyricism. And for every filler track on House Slippers, there are three or four intelligent tracks to make up for them. In other words, the bulk of the album is made up of smart material. Ortiz has invited some rappers and some singers to appear on House Slippers and has even brought his Slaughterhouse group mates (Royce Da 5'9'', Joe Budden, and Crooked I) into the studio for ""Brothers Keeper"" to show that besides being a rap quartet, they are also a family. The production is handled mainly by The Heatmakerz and gives the album a sparkling yet rugged sound. This time around, Joell Ortiz is a more self aware artist who spits fire on the mic over nice hip hop beats. House Slippers is a good addition to his growing body of work."

My Mom would have the radio on and I would lay down and watch as the various neon lights of fast food chains were reflected on the window. We might head to McDonalds for some 'food' or a 'milkshake'. There is a down to earth late night quality to this song, the reverb on the vocals and music, the simple jangly guitar chords, the drum fills. I always liked the name-checking of the various cities in the US - Phoenix, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA. When I got older I often wondered why Tacoma was included, since it's way smaller than the other ones. I thought it might have been a nod to the Tacoma Dome, but that wasn't constructed until 1983. It must be that it sort of rhymes with Arizona. Arizona - Tacoma - Oklahoma - Bologna. Catchy stuff, Steve Miller. He includes all of northern California in his lyrics. Why limit himself to one city when 'the girls are warm' in an entire area? There were probably a lot of girls in northern Cali who heard this song and thought, ""Hey, I live in northern California and I'm warm. He's singing about me!"""

The Swedish band ""Like Swimming's"" rhythm, bass line, vocal and general feeling of this song are kind of late 80's or early 90's to my ears. Somewhat reminiscent of the GoGos, the Bangles, the Cranberries or even Abba. This isn't a bad thing but does make this presentation seem a bit misplaced in time.\n\nI like ""Go Buffalo"" and it will stay in my iPod rotation for a while. If you like sound/feel of that late 80's vibe I think you'll probably enjoy ""Like Swimming"" too.\n\nHope this helps someone!"

Though the mountain seems insurmountable and the process seems difficult, the words of this simple song reassures me that Im not alone my God is with me.  He is God and God alone but not just any god, my God. Though He slays me, yet will I continue to confess He is God, my God. Many times it doesnt work out the way Ive thought or planned but I have resigned myself to say He reigns as my God and my God alone.  When the storms of life are raging He is the crescendo of it all.\nThis song conveys the essence of my praise."

Released in October 2014 by hip hop trio Diamond District (producer Oddisee and emcees yU and Uptown XO) under Mello Music Group, March On Washington just might be the perfect album to reserve for February, Black History Month, to review. Although it doesn't explicitly make race an issue, this crystalline-bright LP, inspired by the event during which Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous I Have A Dream speech, has a sense of vigor and urgency that mimic the 1963 civil rights gathering which it is named after. When the three artists on the album wear their Black pride on their sleeves however, they do so with a good measure of modesty. Boiled down, March On Washington is simply amazing music for all people, irrespective of skin tone. You could listen to this beautiful album a dozen times and still need more plays to capture and appreciate all the gifts it intends to bestow upon its listeners. It's that good.\n\nOddisee, yU and XO hail from the Washington DC area, or the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) as some call it. They're not shy about representing their area with pride, but they're also not obsessed with the practice either thankfully. March On Washington is basically a clarion call to live healthfully. The album's wisdom easily takes the cake, and this wisdom is not the boring, snooze-inducing type but the cool, useful, knowledge-based sort aided of course by a preponderance of superlative rap flows by yU and XO. Each stanza flourishes with excellent lyrical rhymes and undisturbed thoughts on everyday life. Areas explored include the differences among people, critique of the mainstream and lots of bubbly, effervescent proverbs. Diamond District wish to share their preternatural skill, talent and ways of thinking, and the richness and captivating nature of March On Washington prove the group's success to this end. The album is smart but also fun, never losing its lyrical weightiness. The ride is smooth yet hypnotic, as everything rests comfortably on Oddisee's soul-drenched samples and crisp drum set beats. Look out for a few surprises like ""Working Weekends""' squeaky, chirpy alt. sounds. The variety they provide will come in handy.\n\nAlthough only their second album as a group following 2009's In The Ruff, Diamond District have the hip hop heart and substance to make them instant breakout hit makers. Each of the three members are proving themselves singly with outside projects, but together they might be even more special. March On Washington is exciting and philosophical, with lots of slow-bopping replay value that is street tested and boom-bap approved."

The Beauty Of Independence is a great showing of solidarity from G-Unit, considering the fact that all four original members are on the EP. When nature dictates that groups tend to disband over time, this complete reunification is a feat in and of itself. The gang are essentially back to their old antics, and this consistency proves to be a fitting formula. The opener, ""Watch Me,"" brings listeners up to speed and establishes the current level of musicality with which the group is comfortable and proficient. It is gangsta through and through, and as an introduction to G-Unit in 2014, it screams to audiences everywhere, ""Here they are!"" The follow up track, ""I Don't F--- With You,"" is more real gangsterism over concert style cornets, giving way to ""Digital Scale,"" a track almost exclusively dedicated to the subject of drug dealing, a topic which is touched on again in ""The Plug."" Nowhere is this G-Unit crew more eloquent, however, than on ""Changes,"" where they discuss reversals of fortune and how nothing ever really remains the same over time. Overall the guys do a good job of being lyrical on a competitive level, and some nice, new territory is explored production-wise throughout. The Beauty Of Independence is a nice EP with high marks for having good energy and perfect attendance."

I love Two Steps from Hell, and Thomas Bergersen's previous album ""Illusions"" was magnificent (10 stars for that one).  This one sounded better in the 30-sec previews; I found it has a very tribal quality (due to the vocals) upon listening to the tracks all the way through.  It's in my writing playlist rotation, as I don't think it's a bad album...it's just not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it's grown on me the more I've listened to it - one of those cases of familiarity breeding enjoyment.  I don't regret my purchase; this is one I might have delayed, however, if I'd had the forethought to listen to it on YouTube.  While ""Illusions"" remains a masterful work with infinite replay value, ""Sun"" is more a mood thing and one I don't find myself reaching to play as often."

In hip hop, Compton, California instrumentalist, producer, disc jockey, and rapper DJ Quik is one of those continuously exceptional artists who is legendary to his coast and hip hop as a whole. Producing and rapping since the eighties and playing instruments since a child, Quik, or David Blake, has assembled some of the most gorgeous funk and soul beats of all time and has always been an interesting emcee on the mic. He has worked with many figures in the biz from Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube to his frequently recurring collaborators, AMG, 2nd II None, Hi-C, El DeBarge, Suga Free, and Playa Hamm, some of whom appear on Quik's ninth solo album, The Midnight Life. Quik of course infuses his signature funk and soul into the album but puts a different twist on them just for this collection of songs. Cool, original guitar, piano, and horns with strong drums and claps are layered upon each other for a rich, voluptuous audio experience from start to finish. Quik has added some talk boxing, an unusual instrument (by hip hop standards) in the second track, and a jaw dropping concept beat in ""Trapped On The Tracks."" His lyrics are again stimulating and diverse with rhymes, and in addition to the familiar guests are some new ones, Bishop Lamont, David Blake II, and Dom Kennedy. Quik runs the gamut of speaking topics from personal philosophy to natural social phenomena, but his main aim is to have a great time in the musical process. Amongst his various talking points, he hits upon the mark he has made on the game, the beauty of living fly, his seniority in hip hop, just deserts for promiscuous women, and relationship communication. DJ Quik has such appealing, easily identifiable style and flavor that are unique enough so as to require little maintenance over time except for the necessary experimentation for freshness and modern day relevancy. He has put all those things in The Midnight Life, so the new dawn for the Compton raised, music virtuoso looks very bright."

"15024","3","","B00N2SO0BM","4d1373613dabf727cedc8e2b4c6b5ea1ERCM","The Watts, LA-raised, lyrical virtuoso Ras Kass, now over 18 years strong in the game, has banded with underground, boom-bap style producer Apollo Brown (Mello Music Group) for the Blasphemy LP. The Michigan-bred beat maker Brown has constructed a great set of productions that are just as complex and interesting as Ras Kass' lyrics are. As the title suggests, Blasphemy starts with Ras Kass making critical arguments against popular religions, especially Christianity, in ""How To Kill God."" He will continue in this questioning fashion for other tracks, like ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" where he discusses various historical violations of The Golden Rule. Although proclaiming himself a fallen angel, he boasts wisdom all over Blasphemy by preaching clean living (""Please Don't Let Me""), racial equality (""Strawberry"") and moral rules (""48 Laws Pt. 1""). As always though, Ras Kass still finds time to brag, strut and celebrate his gifts. His lyrical game is still sharp after all these years and so is his storytelling, as evidenced by ""Too Much Of A Good Thing"" and ""Francine,"" two songs about demons coming back to haunt mischievous women. Making the perfect beats to match the high caliber lyricism of Kass is no easy task. That's why Apollo Brown has combined eclectic samples, elegant instruments and East Coast style drum beats for a super nice audio event that can claim bits of orchestra, soul and r&b music within its mix.\n\nBlasphemy contains three power-packed posse cuts, but with all the mighty guest verses on the album, they never seem to outshine Kass and his enormous lyrical prominence. Apollo Brown and Ras Kass are both respectful of the hip hop culture and the rap game, even if Kass is picking on industry giants one moment (""Humble Pi"") and saluting deceased legends the next (""Bon Voyage""). They make for a very compelling duo on the risky yet entertaining Blasphemy."

Released by Rhymesayers Entertainment, the same label that released HHM's first LP, Are You Gonna Eat That?, Bestiary contains a more digestible form of its fore- album's bizarre, complex lyricism of wacky, oddball imagery and situations. Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are unruly, aimless badasses, rapping all over the place and in all directions. With their ill rhyme styles, they explore the nature and philosophy of life and death, and their wild, artful rapping accurately mimics the chaos of the world. Taking its name from the word meaning a written account of real and fantasy animals, Bestiary contains some animal imagery but just lots of other imagery too, like art gallery-scale imagery. Despite all the craziness and a few dark undertones, there is a sense of purpose, hope and levity in Bestiary thanks to the ""fund raiser concert"" skits and their do-it-yourself subtext. Coupled with the intelligent, left field lyrics, the samples, scratches, diverse synths and hard rocking drums make Bestiary a truly eccentric specimen of underground, alternative hip hop. It marks a new level of comfort for Hail Mary Mallon that just might prove comforting to audiences as well."

"15045","5","","B00N4FF66G","c5e243c3cf0ba5549321b1c1fbfeac88VNW2","It seems strange now with the hindsight of 46 years distance that 1971's hugely articulate ""Muswell Hillbillies"" by THE KINKS was such a commercial dog. Their newest platter and first with RCA Records was released November 1971 on both sides of the pond - but barely managed a No. 100 placing in the US LP charts with a big fat zilch in the UK.\n\nBut then again 1970's ""Lola Versus Powerman..."" and 1971's Soundtrack to ""Percy"" (both on Pye) hadnt bothered British LP charts either. In fact - excepting obvious crowd-pleasing hit singles between the LPs like ""Lola"" and ""Apeman"" and despite the musical-excellence of what Raymond Douglas Davies & Co. was collectively producing - the public seemed utterly indifferent  especially in their native Blighty. I can recall this album being in bargain bins for decades. Commercially this most British of bands were adrift in arguably their most creative period...\n\nAnd that's where this rather excellent 2014 'Legacy Edition' 2-Disc reissue of ""Muswell Hillbillies"" comes in - determined to get us all to see the error of our fatuous ways. Armed with nine Bonus Tracks and a new DVD of period recordings on Disc 2 (all restored) - here are the cups of tea and pints of beer in the Archway Tavern...\n\nUK released 19 December 2014 (10 November 2014 in the USA) - ""Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition"" by THE KINKS on RCA/Legacy 88843093772 (Barcode 888430937727) is a 2-Disc Reissue and Remaster [1CD + 1DVD] that plays out as follows:\n\nDisc 1 CD ""Muswell Hillbillies"" - The Original Album (72:30 minutes):\n1. 20th Century Man [Side 1]\n2. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n3. Holiday\n4. Skin And Bone\n5. Alcohol\n6. Complicated Life\n7. Here Come The People In Grey [Side 2]\n8. Have A Cuppa Tea\n9. Holloway Jail\n10. Oklahoma U.S.A.\n11. Uncle Son\n12. Muswell Hillbilly\nTracks 1 to 12 are their 11th album ""Muswell Hillbillies"" - released 24 November 1971 in the UK on RCA Victor Records SF 8243 and in the USA on RCA Victor LSP 4644. Produced by Ray Davies - it peaked at No. 100 on the US LP charts - didn't chart in the UK.\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n13. Lavender Lane\n14. Mountain Woman\n15. Have A Cuppa Tea (Alternate Version)\n16. Uncle Son (Alternate Version)\n17. Kentucky Moon\n18. Nobody's Fool (Demo)\n19. 20th Century Man (Alternate Instrumental Take)\n20. Queenie (Backing Track)\n21.

Sunny Afternoon\n7. The Virgin Soldier March\n8. She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\n9. Alcohol\n10. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n11. You Really Got Me\n\nWhat the track list on the rear cover of this Legacy 2-Disc issue doesn't advise is that there's more footage on the DVD in-between tracks than is listed above. ""The Virgin Soldier March"" section includes the whole of the (rather rough) opening credits to the 1969 John Dexter movie ""The Virgin Soldiers"" starring Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett, Nigel Davenport, Nigel Patrick and an uncredited David Bowie as a soldier (Wayne Sleep is credited). It features Ray's music playing throughout with the Mike Cotton Sound being the brass band accompanying him. There is also a short interview with Carl Foreman (clearly a fan of Ray Davies and his articulate writing) discussing how Ray's incendiary British lyrics were re-written/softened by the American studios so as not to offend or illicit riots in Washington (marches that didn't materialise). There is also interviews with the clearly bemused/amused owner of the grimy Archway Tavern Pub in North London and patrons supping pints being asked how they feel now that they've been immortalised on the gatefold album cover (cue more laughter). The Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble are also introduced by Davies to the live audience at The Rainbow and play with The Kinks on three tracks -  ""She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina"", ""Alcohol"" and ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"".\n\nThe three-way foldout digipak offers a new period photo on the left flap with tape boxes pictured beneath each CD and its see-through tray. The 28-page colour booklet is a pleasingly well-endowed affair - pictures of Ray alongside black and whites/colours of the decidedly longhaired five-piece band. The booklet's front and back cover reproduce that photo where the 'Cats On Holiday' shop is all but obliterated by aluminium sheeting. The four-leaf foldout display of centre pages shows foreign picture sleeves for ""20th Century Man"" (Japan) and sheet music to ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" as well as trade adverts and reviews - it even has a 26 June 1972 ticket stub for the Free Trade Hall in Manchester with Steve Goodman as the support act. IRA ROBBINS of New York provides the very entertaining and well-written liner notes - examining the album's themes of Her Majesty's Government interference in normal people's lives - inner city alienation - people in red coming to take him away - all of this working-class British angst wrapped up in American imagery of Shirley Jones, Errol Flynn and Doris Day.\n\nANDREW SANDOVAL - who handled all of the Universal 'Deluxe Editions' for The Kinks Pye years - is the Project co-ordinator once again. But the big news is a new Remaster - the first generation tapes transferred by RICHARD WHITTAKER at FX Mastering in London and the Remastering carried out by the vastly experienced VIC ANESINI at Battery Studios in New York. Anesini is a name I actively seek out - he's sprinkled his knob-twiddling fairy dust magic on the catalogues of Elvis Presley, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds, Nilsson, Santana, The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mountain, Carole King and many more. This album was always a muddy mess to me - compounded by that 'Flexi' vinyl crap RCA engaged in at the beginning of the decade. There are hissy moments still on this remastered CD (the acoustic beginning of ""Holiday"" is just one of them) - but those slide guitars on ""Holloway Jail"" and the barroom piano on ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" now have more oomph for damn sure. That drum and guitar intro to ""Skin And Bone"" has fantastic punch all of a sudden - and there are other moments too. A good job done that's allowed the LP to breathe anew...\n\nAs Ray sings ""...I was born in a welfare state...ruled by bureaucracy...controlled by civil servants...and people dressed in grey..."" on the brilliant opener ""20th Century Man"" - you gather our Douglas is concerned once again for England's no-longer green and pleasant land and especially its increasingly homogenised and divided populace. Many critics commented on the depth of the song themes and lyrics (there's a lot of them) and their social commentary and insight  but it didn't seem to move the buying public in the same way. Just after the albums release - RCA put the song ""20th Century Man"" out as a US 45 in December 1971 (RCA Victor 74-0620) with the equally hard-hitting social consciousness of ""Skin And Bone"" on the B-side. But despite the lyrical/musical strengths of both sides - there were few takers. RCA Britain didn't even bother to support the album with a 7"" single - their first UK 45 on RCA Victor being the new ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" in May 1972  which in itself acted as an advance promotion for the ""Everybody's In Show Biz"" double in August.\n\nThe hippy dream is dead and nailed to the wall in the brilliant ""Alcohol"" where some floozy has fleeced a heartbroken sucker - and The Kinks begin to sound awfully like Lindisfarne's ""Fog On The Tyne"" on ""Complicated Life"" (the accordion and guitars are clearer). You also notice how well he's integrated the Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble into ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" and ""Holloway Jail"". I never was a fan of the 'Hallelujah Rosie Lea' cod nostalgia of ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" - but I'm loving the slide acoustic guitars of ""Uncle Son"" where The Kinks sound like Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance three years before the event. Recorded 17 October 1971 at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London - the album finisher and title track ""Muswell Hillbillies"" could easily be one of those Rolling Stones Country-Rock jaunts they throw so effectively into the Blues-Rock mix of their albums (""Let It Bleed"" and ""Sticky Fingers"" jump to mind).\n\nAnd as ridiculously good outtakes - you'd have to call ""Lavender Lane"" (a sort of acoustic ""Waterloo Sunset""), ""Mountain Woman"" and the superb piano pain of ""Kentucky Moon"" - more evidence of the album's greatness (even the rejects were hitting the mark). The 50-second Radio Spot advert tells of ""Album of The Year"" from many American publications - but the public itself thought otherwise. It's also nice to see the Old Grey Whistle Test and Rainbow footage so clean - and dig those credits to ""The Virgin Soldiers"" movie from 1969 with Raymond Douglas Davies credited for the music (his full name used).\n\nI'd admit that the hiss levels on some tracks are disappointing - but as I re-listen to this excellent remaster - I'm digging it more and more and my admiration for the LP has gone through the roof. Fans apparently magic-markered their song requests onto paper plates at gigs - flinging them stage-ward as the Band played. Flick your schizophrenic paper plates this way and hope for a reply..."
"15046","5","","B00N4FF66G","b3df78532d4ba1bddd24baeaa7cb816e2FB2","With their record contracts with Pye and Reprise being expired in 1971, The Kinks\n  felt free to pursue a new recording contract that led them to secure a record deal with\n  RCA Records which resulted with the release of this highly accomplished album later\n  that year. Officially billed as a definition to the bands crossover albums from the late-\n  1960s, Muswell Hillbillies successfully repeated the influences of Music Hall with the\n  traditional American stylings of country music and bluegrass well thrown in to careful\n  well-structured effect as it focuses the alienation of the working man and takes place\n  at Muswell Hill, a London suburb where Ray and Dave Davies were brought up while\n  it contain songs which focuses on working class life and again, on Davies childhood.\n  With the superlative music brilliantly composed by Ray and performed by the band to\n  utmost empathy, the track set starts off with the supercharged hit single 20th Century\n  Man as it concludes merrily with heart and sensibility on other songs, including Acute\n  Schizophrenia, Paranoia Blues, Holiday, Skin And Bone, Here Come The People In\n  Grey, Have A Cuppa Tea and Muswell Hillbilly (Alcoholic and Skin And Bone are the\n  most atypical classics in The Kinks catalogue).  As one of the bands finest and most\n  beloved masterworks, Muswell Hillbillies was greeted with critical acclaim but started\n  out as a fair accomplishment on the charts upon its official release, then its success\n  soon caught on.  And what made the album as appealing is the album cover that was\n  taken at The Archway Tavern as it shows the band below a signpost giving directions\n  to Muswell Hill which add to the albums truly unforgettable epitomized successone\n  that will remain a captivatingly outright and astonishing work of art. Plus you will hear\n  the albums radio commercial which just wraps up the remastered finishing touch."

To brighten up these rosy realities for Double-M.G., label mate Stalley (Kyle Myricks) has just released his debut solo LP, Ohio, which is of course named after his home state. True to his roots, musical influences and the MMG code, Stalley has filled Ohio with enough hustlin', stuntin' and Midwestern hoo- ridin' so that fans can easily recognize his brand and affiliations. His fluid flow is sufficiently varied in style and vocabulary, and the different inflections of his tone of voice give his rapping an animated, non-mechanized feel. Stalley discusses his hard times coming up in life but also mellows out by indulging in the club scene, lady loves, fashion and cars, particularly the sporty, high-performance type. Speaking of cars, Stalley has created an intriguing interpolation/remake of Eazy-E's ""Boyz-N-The- Hood"" single, called ""Jackin' Chevys,"" about getting it on in hot, stolen cars. Ohio is a relatively singular affair for Stalley except for guest appearances by Nipsey Hussle, Rick Ross, August Alsina, Ty Dolla Sign and Rashad, who produced much of the album's music. As a pleasant surprise, Stalley has also brought legends De La Soul out of retirement to spit a few bits of wisdom for listeners on ""Navajo Rugs."" The productions contain some real instruments and original beat loops but several sound like recreations of trap/drill standards, not necessarily a bad thing considering the album as a whole has a very unique, distinct sound beneath the lyrics. The most important fact to note about Ohio is that Stalley has not fully fallen prey to commercial, music market appetites. Instead, he has mixed up his content and style with new concepts and fresh rhymes and music, making for a solid enough solo debut."

It has always has seemed to me, that each compilation released, has been thoughtful in its sequencing,to eventually create a unique listening experience. And more importantly , that the artist was present.  The same could be said for Nothing Has Changed. The reversed chronology of the album, and the different versions , plus the bonus or unreleased material , makes this required  Bowie listening for the die hard and the novice. This is not a schlock-y, hastily put together, jukebox-y collection of single edits for mass appeal. It's a thoughtful walk with Bowie through his entire career, and the many moods, and aural experiments we we were privileged to hear."

Theres reverence in SACRED and I could feel what THE PAINTER feels as he paints a picture; a stroke of apprehension, a dash of this hue with a dash of that on his palette, then a flourish of brushstrokes after that point of reckoning.

It soothes the mind and consoles the heart. You can easily plunge into the stream of these amazing improvisational tunes.\n\nHealing Hearts is a new album of the highest quality of composing and performing. All the compositions of Louis Landon as usual are melodious and thoughtful. The artist brings perfection to every note.\n\nLouis Landon continues to surprise the listener. His music is unexpected and unpredictable. The improvisations of Louis Landon are exciting. And at the same time his musical language is very clear and full of purity, therefore the new project of Louis Landon will be interesting for a wide circle of audience.\n\nHealing Hearts is the kind of album which you will want to listen to time and again.

Since his move, Landon has established Healing Piano of Sedona which offers a unique sound healing experience to create mental, physical and emotional well-being. Landon is a Steinway Artist who has toured internationally and has released seventeen albums, eleven of which are solo piano (one is a best of). He has been using the techniques of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for spiritual development since 1980. Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously, passionately, stress- and disease-free.\n\nThe thirteen tracks on ""Healing Hearts"" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well-being. I have to admit that in the past, I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music, but he is improvising and performing so much now that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and complete and the emotional content is rich and sincere. Landon has performed house concerts in my series every year for the past seven years and while his music has always been exceptionally good, now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty. Nothing is held back, coming from the purest source of creativity. Im blown away by the music on ""Healing Hearts"" and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014.\n\nMost of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity. In fact, Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace and I can see why! A couple of pieces are a bit livelier, but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background. However, be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment, the day, or life in general - at least for a while.\n\nAll of the tracks are exceptional, but Ill mention a few favorites. Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful, tender and very warm. Gorgeous! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful. I love the title track, which is more minor and a bit darker, but so poignant and compelling. Now or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently but firmly. Sacred is almost hymn-like. The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member who passed away recently. Dark and sometimes painfully sad, there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit that can flow from one artist to another. Unstoppable begins quietly and simply, gradually building energy, strength and power. Unstoppable, indeed! A great, upbeat ending to a fantastic album!\n\n""Healing Hearts"" is a must-hear! Very highly recommended!"

I took off a fifth star solely due to the excessive dynamic range compression required nowadays to satisfy the unquenchable thirst of musicians and labels for tracks to be made louder amd louder.  On my Foobar 2000 meter this track clocked in at DR4 - equivalent to 4dB of crest factor, or average to peak loudness!  That's shameful, given digital audio's potential for 90dB of dynamic range or more.  Artists: Please stop demanding your music be so loud it has to be squashed into digital full scale!

Four highly regarded mixtapes of Southern flair and wisdom have done more than create a buzz for K.R.I.T., and his 2012 studio debut, Live From The Underground, secured his position as one of The Dirty's top rap prophets of the new era.\n\nThis Cadillactica LP is a full examination of god, life, love and pain from K.R.I.T.'s unique perspective in which he explores many topics. He places great weight on the love and cohesion of family when he laments about the anguish of broken, disconnected families in ""Soul Food."" Additionally, his gentlemanly side comes out in ""Pay Attention"" and ""Third Eye"" where he raps about fine, refined ladies. K.R.I.T.'s planet of abstract thought, or what he calls his Cadillactica, is a serene, confident mind state that makes obvious the name of his favorite make of town car. Cadillac imagery pops up in ""Cadillactica"" and the allegorical ""Do You Love Me For Real"" about the love that a man has for his woman and his ride. Toward the end of the album, he gets critical of music industry trends and encourages having an open mind. At various points, K.R.I.T. takes the liberty of jumping around with subject matter but remains logical and makes everything come together as relatable under the same roof. He has a refreshing fighting spirit of hopefulness that appropriately remedies the sadness and adversity in his surroundings. At the same time he is exceptionally lyrical, poetic and metaphorical with his swaggering flow. Because of his brainy, philosophical rumination, one might think the man too soft, but the moments where he gets tough and vicious instantly invalidate that idea.\n\nBig K.R.I.T. has produced some of the album, but he has also invited several other producers to give Cadillactica a very original musical vibe. Perhaps not as sample heavy as some of his mixtapes, Cadillactica contains fresh synths, throwback loops, an 808-style bass line or two, and other funky instruments like the jazzy, muted trumpet in ""Mo Better Cool,"" which also contains hip, danceable, drum taps. All the sounds light up the album like stars in a night sky. Several talented singers and rappers contribute verses but never asphyxiate K.R.I.T.'s artistic expression.\n\nCadillactica is a colorful, comprehensive mosaic of musical influences. It's not hard to identify the different rappers who K.R.I.T. has drawn from for his style, but rest assured, his is a unique, one of a kind style that can hold up on its own. As the title to the seventh track suggests, K.R.I.T. is a rising king of the South who is giving other South stars like T.I. and Lil Wayne a run for the money. His talent and exuberance in Cadillactica make for an album that will have a special place in the hearts of fans ""4eva."""

Hearing about the tragic death of Malcolm Young, one of the musical virtuosos of AC/DC, was just a devastating shock. Hard to believe he passed away after leaving the group 3 years ago, and privately battling with dementia that crippled him. Now with his death, he joins his musical brother Bon Scott, who died over 35 years ago, after he had long-fronted the group. But with Brian Johnson taking the helm, AC/DC hit their commercial peak with Back In Black. Through that album, AC/DC had a lot of great songs through that album. But nevertheless, the group had a lot of wonderful anthems, and You Shook Me All Night Long remains one of AC/DC's finest. The song is a real feel-good boogie rhythm that still ignites today from the heart and soul of the music. Whenever I hear this year, I think of all the joy AC/Dc brought to a mass appeal that no rock group had ever been able to do before. Now, with Malcolm Young passing on, his legacy is enshrined with some of guitar's greatest heroes like Jimi Hendrix and Chicago's Terry Kath and B.B. King. May Malcolm Young be forever remembered, shaking us all night long.\n\nMalcolm Young: 1953-2017\n\nSong: B+"

AC/DC's sound; so distinct, so clean and tight, so ""RAW ROCK"" that each new generation that comes along hears the unique, universal, driving sound, and the newbies pick it up and makes this band their own. I've listened to this band for more years than I'll ever admit to, and I have every album they ever made. Through the years, behind the music, there was a story that is still being written. I'm reviewing this one because it was one of the best featuring the original singer, Bon Scott. Bon had a cynical but humorous outlook that was loved by all. He took care of the band like raising his kid brothers. His tongue in cheek bravado, kept the band together. His unwavering confidence in his boys was absolute. Just listen to the lyrics. In the beginning they barely earned enough money to eat, or clothe themselves. Their sound was distinct and catching. During an interview, someone asked Angus Young what kind of ""effects"" did he use to get his sound. Angus replied that he didn't; he simply plugged in his Gibson SG Custom (that guitar costs about $7000 nowadays, and was/is one of the only Gibson guitars that ever came out of the factory with a tremulow bar. The custom has pearl inlay, double humbucker coils, and Gibson guitars is one of the few guitars that are built out of SOLID mahogany, topped off with a lock nut, that will NOT, even after an hour of being tortured, GO OUT OF TUNE!) Angus took this, arguably, best guitar ever made,  and plugged it into a monster Marshal stack and turned it up as loud as it would go...and that's it. No effects or mixing. Just balls to the walls Rock. And one last thing: Angus' brother Malcolm. If the truth be known, Malcolm's PERFECT rhythm guitar playing MADE AC/DC's sound. While Angus, the band's ""gimmick"" --dressed in his (for real) school uniform-- ran around out front, amazing the crowds, playing some of the best riffs of all time, with his small stature, the crowd thought it was a CHILD eating this guitar alive. While getting all of this attention...well, it was MALCOLM that carried their sound. He stayed off to the side in the shadows, his head bowed in concentration, he never looked up, no one paid any attention, but Malcolm had this incredible timing and that big fat rhythm sound, and he never EVER, so much as missed a single chord! The cleanest rhythm I ever heard. Wow...One of the kings of the Guitar Rock era.\n  I wrote this review for Bon (RIP) and Malcom."

She had honestly grown her voice, but also showed some really great songs over a career that still ignites. She has definitely shown a sweetness in her voice that still ignites all of these years, after she went on her own. But nevertheless, many people do not know her well with cover songs. But No More ""I Love You's"" honestly remains one of my favorite cover songs of her career that is a sweet, haunting, somber but beautiful song that still ignites from the soul of her voice. She definitely made a cover work even better, and it is honestly one of my favorite tracks Annie had recorded back in the 90's, that really is worth listening too. If you have honestly loved her recent cover of I Put A Spell On You, than you absolutely will love this classic cover she did from her Medusa album. I sincerely recommend this classic song.\n\nSong: B+"

But honestly, so many of those simply legendary divas have either retired, stopped making music, or just passed away. That has been the case with so many pop divas from Whitney Houston, or Tammy Wynette. And there have been some divas that have never gotten the credit they rightfully deserve. Phyllis Hyman was one of those divas. Hard to believe that it has been over twenty years since she tragically committed suicide and just left behind a mark that was never given the commercial success that acts like Patti LaBelle or Aretha Franklin have garnished. When I think of what Phyllis had as a singer, I think of so many of her brilliant songs, and Living All Alone is one of them. It is just a soaring ballad that speaks so well from the soul that is haunting and beautiful. Phyllis had sung so soulfully, that she really could have been able to move mountains, but no river was cast over stone for the populace. I would say many of today's divas that have no voice or soul whatsoever like Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna or Ariana Grande could learn a thing from what Phyllis had recorded over the years. This is a great song, and a beautiful download for new and die hard fans of the great Phyllis Hyman.\n\nSong: A 1/2-"

Some of the albums are not my type of music and so I don't have them, but that certainly my personal taste in music doesn't determine their quality or value.\n\nBach Guild seems to be fairly responsive to fixing errors in the songs. I do have one SUGGESTION FOR BACH GUILD: Run your MP3s through MP3gain (can be found for free at Sourceforge) and they will all be the same volume.  This is what I do (89.0 dB) immediately upon downloading my new albums, however for those who choose to stream from Amazon you have to deal with the constant volume changes until Amazon adds volume normalization.  Bach Guild also seems to be doing a good job at filling out the Metadata properly:  Song title, Artist (who performed it).  I just have to add ""Composer"" which takes 5 seconds."

That being said, the album's subject matter can be quite repetitive with most of the album being drugs and money, but its his pop-rap vocals and pop infused hip/hop beats that will keep you entertained, and isn't that what an artist who been out for over a decade should aim to do. The album is filled with drug and money references and plenty of male ego (without the misogynistic of most rappers). I especially love the song ""Invisible Set Baguette"" a song bout his grillz, especially with lines like ""every time I smile my grandma catch the Holy Ghost"" and ""diamonds in my mouth dancing like Debbie Allen"". With sounds like that it's had to take this rapper too serious, but one you can listening to on your commute and enjoy the lyrics and beats."
"15926","1","","B00PGI49P8","4d1373613dabf727cedc8e2b4c6b5ea1ERCM","Far removed is Houston rapper Paul Wall from his glory days of record label-promoting and genre-defining collaborations with fellow Houston rapper Chamillionaire, who teamed up with Wall in the late 1990s to form The Color Changin' Click before disbanding around 2005. A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music. Wall's seventh LP, The Po-Up Poet, is more material of Wall's archetypal style, filled with notions of weed, money, cars, ladies, jewelry and lots of ""drank."" Never one to blow minds with advanced lyricism, Paul Wall has historically received regards for his raps of steady rhyming, and this same modus operandi is applied faithfully by Wall in Po-Up. He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks ""No Favors,"" a lesson in self-reliance, and ""Codeine Heartbreak,"" where Wall discusses his love/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album. The electronic trap beats match all of Wall's objectives and while formulaic, they are just original enough to be tolerable. At this point in Wall's career, The Po-Up Poet is a subpar effort, only attractive to die hard Paul Wall obsessives."

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers, who has became more like a manufactured product, and not even a real human songstress anymore. When it had came to pulling out a surprise record for the music industry and for her own fans, she honestly made a poor choice of songs for herself, and lost the ability to reach into a human soul. Her collaboration with Nicki MInaj on the remix of her wasted song Flawless, was definitely a poor choice of song to collaborate. Nicki doesn't actually make a bad song good, she makes a poor song, want to wish you plugged your ears and never heard Beyonce' or Nicki ever again. There is absolutely no chemistry together in the song, and as for Beyonce', she really wasted her own talent away by trying to be more street and rough, and lagging the talent from her own voice to follow in suite.

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's ""Forget Him"" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again."

"16075","3","5","B00Q5U53CY","59b64701e6eeebec48e19e2d829f72b8HIL2","Ridley Scott has always been a director who knows how to incorporate score in his pictures, his track record with composers has been excellent. Hes created films with classic scores from composers like Vangelis, Jerry Goldsmith, Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams, Marc Streitenfeld and more. But even Ridley is not immune to that infamous Spanish tax credit that studios are flocking to. Theres a reason why Roque Ba&ntilde;os is scoring Ron Howards In The Heart Of The Sea and not Hans Zimmer, theres a reason why Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez scored Brett Ratners Hercules, theres a reason why Lucas Vidal's name is on Fast & Furious 6 and theres a reason why Alberto Iglesias is scoring Exodus: Gods And Kings. These (very talented) composers aren't getting these big breaks because of their creative abilities and match to the films material, no they are getting hired because their country of birth is paying Hollywood some nice incentives to do so. While I love Alberto Iglesias and his work, he ended up on this film because of his nationality and that forces Ridley to work with a composer hes never worked with before. So when you see that two other composers including Harry Gregson-Williams had to chip into this score, maybe studios will realize that creative corner-cutting isn't the best way to pocket some tax breaks.\n\nNow, Exodus is in no way a bad score. This is a fantastically robust and lush score that relishes in its biblical epic genre of music. However, after powering through the mammoth amount of music, one cant help feel a bit of emotional disconnect. The music is beautiful to listen to and at times is gorgeous, but I found a hard time latching onto any emotional arcs. Everything here seems built to embellish and match the bombastic visuals. In that sense you could say the music is theatrical, but given that the film takes itself very seriously one could feel the music is doing too much at times. It took me a while to find the motifs in the score, and I still cant be sure if Im hearing a central theme. When you have that much music, and no clear thematic material then you feel lost and aimless. It has all of the expected structures and elements. You got the big lush orchestrations for weight, you have the Middle Eastern elements to establish your Egyptian setting, big chorus to add gravitas, and percussive action for the battles (thanks to Harry Gregson-Williams). While all the ingredients are there, the score never really establishes its own identity. I never felt emotionally moved or engrossed by the music despite how beautiful its approach was. It almost seemed like a stage performance I was watching, but admiring from afar and never getting pulled into the narrative. The fact that Harry Gregson-Williams was called in for action support and Federico Jusid was called in for support in the spiritual and emotional department, shows that there were lots of leaky holes that needed plugging up. Harry did the same thing for Ridley on Prometheus. However, here Harry would have been probably the most ideal choice here given his masterpiece of a score to Scotts Kingdom Of Heaven. In the end the score is completely adequate, it fulfills its duties completely. However, when you go into a Ridley Scott film, you're expecting a musical accompaniment that is just as special as the story its accompanying. With Exodus: Gods And Kings you will find a large-scale orchestral score with all the expected elements to it, and not much else.\n\nAlberto Iglesias is a brilliant composer, but his talents are better suited for certain films and a Ridley Scott epic is not one of those films. Everything does work, nothing about the score is terrible but nothing is great either. What we have here is a serviceable score that brings the expected ingredients to the table and serves us a dish weve all tasted before. Sure we love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but it would have been nice to try something fresh and new with a little more personality to it. The additional music from Harry Gregson-Williams and Federico Jusid do stand out as stylistically different, but are much needed for support. Exodus: Gods And Kings embraces the biblical epic genre, but in the end the score won't stick with you for long. As a person who believes in continued creative collaboration, I think it's very counter productive for studios to force directors to work with composers just for a tax break. Alberto Iglesias is an amazing composer, but if the main reason you're working on a film is because the studio gets some cash back in their pockets then it completely defeats the purpose of a natural creative collaboration. The final product speaks for itself, adequacy without memorability."

Tracks such as BELOVED, WALKING JOY are ideal to turn on when you're looking for a retreat. Theres a good contrast and conflicting kind of mood in TWO HEARTS; sometimes going together, sometimes moving apart though still a part of the whole. RHAPSODY and WHEN I THINK OF YOU are pensive, lost deep in thought as the music plays on ebony and ivory."

"16096","4","","B00Q7SKT28","be4edae88f523c6a2ae48376fde792280IA6","I did not react too good to Bob Dylan as Sinatra-like crooner, although I gave it a shot as I like to think of myself as musically open minded. I've kind of worked backwards with his most recent trilogy, starting with Triplicate, and then moving on to Fallen Angels. Finally, I recently made it to the first album in the trilogy, Shadows in the Night. What at first seemed odd, out of place and wrong, now seems so perfectly right. I just didn't like Dylan in this guise because his voice it seems was always suited to raspy, bluesy, earthy rock numbers. His unique voice is perfect for that. But not for the Great American Songbook material he's been doing recently. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that you needed a pure, beautiful, golden, old fashioned crooner voice to do this stuff justice. You know, Sinatra, Dino, Ella, Bing, Judy, and the Divine Sarah. Dylan's voice would seem out of place here, and he does sort of miss the notes in a way that sounds like someone who can barely sing. But I kind of knew that if I gave these recordings more time and listening space, I might be able to get them. And I was right, big time.\n  Dylan uses his ragged and torn voice to not just caress these tunes, but inhabit them. Get into their very fiber and core. Find out what makes them tick, and then recreate them all over. And you can have the most ripped up voice in the world and still make these songs magnificent. It takes two things: genius and care. Bob certainly has the genius, and after good, hard listening you see he really cares about this music deeply. It's not a sort of ""Oh this worked great for Rod Stewart so I'll try it too"" thing. Rod has the fantastic voice but just doesn't seem to care much in the music. Dylan knocks it out of the park. I am constantly amazed when an album by Bob that I didn't seem to get and thought was subpar or terrible, turns out to be, after time and care, really good if not really great. Chalk Shadows in the Night up on that very long list.\n  You don't see musicians like this come along every day, and Dylan's like won't be seen again for maybe a hundred years or more. If ever. So this is precious stuff. Pick it up and swim in it's melancholy. It's worth it.----------PEACE"

There have been more songs about the artists' images, rather than the sincerity from the heart. But it is very rare that a song from television that has stood the test of time even after the fame. That has been the case when The Fray came out in the 2000 decade. They were alright in regards to their music with a few songs. But however, when their songs made it big for shows like Grey's Anatomy. That has shown with one of my favorite guilty pleasure songs from that decade, How To Save A Life. The song really is The Fray's biggest hit at the soul and song at heart. It is one of those songs that really is worth what the money is from the group. They have honestly had other songs that were worth that dollar as well like You Found Me a few years later. But if you really would like to hear one song from The Fray, well this would be the song that you should go to first. I recommend you download this track.\n\nSong: B 1/2+"

However, I admit that I find Lets Dance to be enjoyable to listen to."

Anyhow, Im only guessing the meaning (due to the fact that I have not yet looked up the meaning online) but Im guessing that this song is about taking in and enjoying life (due to the mention of a party in this song).

Chicagoan Ryley Walker is able to conjure up the sounds of these UK artists circa 1970 with astonishing accuracy.  Walker and his cohorts play with strong chops and are very good at blurring the lines between these influences.  That said, one gets the feeling of tribute here more than harnessing these sounds and talents towards creating something new and fresh.  That also said, it's as good a listen, or better than much of what I have encountered in 2015.  Mr. Walker is one to watch, I hope he sets his talents free next time out and encounters HIS true voice rather than those of his idols.  I believe he has the talent to do something special."

While he does not have the best singing voice, at the very least there is genuine emotion behind his singing.

Sadly, the songs do not ignite when it really comes to the heart. Yet, he has also made some poor choices in his words and his work. Him marry Kim Kardashian has really made some very bad bedfellows and his songs just haven't been as strong as other rappers. Only One, his collaboration with Paul McCartney doesn't actually hit the strong nail on the head. It actually feels more mixed than actually anything that really has came from the heart. I personally found the song to be less of his professional game than anything that really proved to be strong for everyone. It isn't like what Run D.M.C. did with Aerosmith on Walk This Way years ago, but honestly he could've had a bit more to work with Paul. If you are a fan of Kanye's, than you'll download the song. Otherwise, you will go somewhere else.\n\nSong: C-"

It reminds me that today .....each day....is Day One of the rest of our lives. For me that is both a sobering and inspiring thought due to the fact, as we all know,  that our days on earth are numbered, and once the day has gone by it is gone, there is no way to go back and relive it or change it. Also we are not promised tomorrow. So this song reminds me to try to live each day to the fullest, to glorify the Lord who holds our times in His hand, and to live each day in such a way that I do not have to repent of ungodly actions or words that hurt my friends, family, or any human being that I come in contact with, in case I'm not here tomorrow to reflect and say I'm sorry. But on a positive note, the song also reminds me that yesterday is gone and it is Day one of the rest of my life so I can determine to make a new start and turn the tide of my life with God's help, so I can be a blessing to those around me and sow to the Spirit so I can reap goodness and blessings in my life and bring glory to Him who saved me. Glory to my Lord Jesus Christ who shed His blood upon the cross and conquered death so we could have eternal life and be cleansed by His blood of all our sins. This gift He offers to all who call upon His name."

She sadly passed away 3 1/2 years ago, but the heart and soul of her beautiful and enchanting voice had never lost its luster, while she did lose her own soul in singing, largely from every lampooning her and abusing her to death, as the ""Crack Is Whack"" joke, and not looking at whom she had been as a delightful human being. Now, with thinking of Whitney Houston's passing, and the recent passing of her one and only baby Bobbi Kristina Brown, I am constantly reminded of the deep sadness, and sincerity she left behind in each and every note she sung from her beloved heart. I Look To You remains a dominant example, hearing the song for the first time as we were all dealing with the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, and at the same day of his funeral, I really was so reminded of when a voice and song can deeply hit you, and this song really hit the nail on the head. R. Kelly really wrote a masterpiece for Whitney Houston, and if you had never heard a song she had recorded, than you must download this song.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012\n\nSong: A+"

Female singers have became more like they are products than people. for singers, like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna have really missed the mark when it came down to voice. But out of all the female singers past and present, the great Whitney Houston has been one of those songstresses that not only sung brilliant and beautiful songs, but they all came out when we all dealing with heartbreak. I Didn't Know My Own Strength is one of my favorite tracks from I Look To You. When I first heard the song, I was sincerely brought to tears, as the last notes that Diane Warren wrote specifically for Ms. Houston, we were all dealing with the passing of Farrah Fawcett, Ed McMahon and Michael Jackson all on the same week in June of 2009. The song was not only beautiful first hearing it, but definitely one Whitney's finest during her lifetime. While people don't think of this song as much as I Will Always Love You, it is a song I  sincerely recommend listening to from the deepest soul of ""The Voice's"" Heart.

Ironically, 50 hardly even appears on this The Beast Is G-Unit EP, aside from one: a wooing autotune bit opening the introductory ""Ballin,"" and two: the chorus of ""Boy Boy."" G-Unit's six year hiatus proved their best marketing tool for The Beauty Of Independence, which overall performed well. The guys were gallantly back on their gangsta schtick with some renewed and newfound spirit. The same is true for The Beast Is G-Unit, except this one suffers the fate of coming after Beauty.\n\nIn relation to before, the repetition in content includes the gangsterism, pimping, worship of big boy toys, and various other infractions of the law that the five-piece crew commit on this round's excursion. The mostly-complete gang of Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Kidd Kidd (50 Cent barely contributes) are satisfactorily lyrical for the most part, relegating their gifts to street life matters and proving to fans that they can still band-up after all these years. Notwithstanding that fact, Lloyd Banks, out of all the members, gives the EP the brightest signs of lyrical virtuosity, throwing in different rhythms and tempos and basically just showing the most free-spirited character of any in the bunch.\n\nAside from needing to be there and appealing to a new class of hip hop listeners, the beats walk a thin line between relevancy and redundancy, harnessing the nervous, temporal energy of drill- ticks and a few sounds from G-Unit's past, i.e., organ, wavering electric guitar and ringing piano. Although The Beast Is G-Unit is lyrically on par with anything from the group's past, it still remains skimpy on intelligent, advanced art, making the biggest impact by being stunning, shocking and thrilling as opposed to the aesthetic of being fascinating and intriguing from an intellectual standpoint."

The concept definitely has its appeal: one person betrays another and the betrayer receives a presumably well-deserved dressing-down accessible to thousands or perhaps millions of people. Who wouldn't want that kind of outlet? Though the threat of such exposure likely won't eliminate or even reduce these situations from humanity's intimate relations, it may provide some consolation and opportunities for healing to the betrayed. Of course, the number of people with feasible recourse to mass accusation remains somewhat on an infinitesimal level. Most people turn to the obvious sources of family and friends when confronted with a demeaning and egregious loss of trust in a loved one. Perhaps social media now serves as an additional platform for venting loss on an even wider scale, at least for those seeking it, in our increasingly attention-hungry society. Others may choose to suffer and heal in private, camouflaged from the potential messiah complexes and morbid curiosities that inevitably lurk in any public sphere. Either way, those who both possess a large audience and also wish to share their damaged feelings, warts and all, with a wider population may indirectly assist those without such means in coping with their own deeply personal experiences of amorous disloyalty. The realization that even prominent public figures can face personal acts of shameful dishonesty within their own inner circles might help comfort those more lonely sufferers simply by the mere suggestion that others do experience such wrenching and humiliating pain. These same others also overcome their losses and regenerate their lives afterwards, often for the better. As such, celebrities who outwardly display their emotional upheavals through their work do risk charges of narcissism or puerile selfishness. ""Entertain us,"" some fans may exhort, ""don't whine at us!"" Yet these explicit and seemingly self-serving displays also potentially enrich and support those who seek more from entertainment than mere sensual pleasure.\n\nAlong those lines, some may have rolled their eyes upon hearing rumors of Bjork's so-called ""infidelity album."" ""Here we go again,"" they may have sighed, ""another celebrity had another inevitable celebrity breakup and she now wants the rest of us to wallow with her in her emotional misery."" Given some of the history of artists venting their personal frustrations and disappointments through their songwriting, this reaction seems somewhat understandable. Not only that, Bjork often comes under fire for ""pretentiousness"" because of her unabashed artistic and experimental approach to music and image. The esoteric title of the album, ""Vulnicura,"" meaning ""cure for wounds,"" probably didn't quiet the ""snooty police."" Not only that, some former fans have decried her move away from more ""accessible"" material, often citing the earlier album ""Homogenic"" as a yet unsurpassed peak. Though undoubtedly a fantastic album, Bjork made it clear that she had no intention of simply repeating her crowd-pleasing, best-selling, most talked about efforts. She moved on. Subsequent albums have met with almost equal praise and criticism as the music became even more complex, cutting edge and at times approaching the avant-garde. The rhythms became more staccato and jarring on ""Biophilia"" as the album's ambience seemed to simultaneously encompass both entire chunks of the universe and the most microscopic existential realms. ""Vulnicura"" continues the electronic exploration while incorporating compositional elements of ""Homogenic,"" ""Biophilia"" and aspects of ""Volta,"" but nonetheless it creates something distinct. Many of its pieces and themes apparently emerged via the healing process that accompanied a painful breakup allegedly originating from her partner's infidelity. The album overall avoids myopic individualism in its themes and instead treats them abstractly enough to allow anyone to identify or interpret the lyrics to their own circumstances. ""Vulnicura"" is not memoir.\n\nFar from self-indulgent melodrama, ""Vulnicura"" contains some of Bjork's most stunningly beautiful and moving work. ""Stonemilker,"" an absolutely gorgeous opener saturated with strings, openly and nakedly begs for emotional expression and respect as the strings soar with painful longing. The title's intriguing meaning gets revealed in the line ""What is it that I have, that makes me feel your pain? Like milking a stone, to get you to say it."" Many people will probably identify with the analogy of ""milking a stone"" when confronted with the emotional betrayal of a loved one. Not only does it appear quite futile, any real effort at drawing milk from a stone would probably result in considerable pain. If only stones could lactate. Oh well. ""Lionsong"" seems to muse on the reaction of the betrayer to the situation at hand while also dismissing any real concern: ""Maybe he will come out of this, maybe he won't, somehow I'm not too bothered either way."" With equally juicy strings, a similar brooding mood to the previous song also pervades this second track. Such situations present a frustratingly complicated multidimensional matrix, which this song seems to examine. Will he come out? Maybe, maybe not, who cares? Well, I'm curious, but I really don't care. Also, the line ""it's a sign of maturity to be stuck in complexity"" seems to excoriate simple black and white emotional interpretations. These situations cause real anguish, confusion and perplexity that defy words. Music can sometimes get the feelings across, and ""Lionsong"" largely succeeds in communicating the inevitable miasma. The considerably more electronic ""History of Touches"" delves into a remembered intimate moment that in retrospect felt tinged with a lurking finality. But all such moments seem simultaneously omnipresent. A sensuous oneness floats above the staggering and indistinct background keyboards. ""Black Lake"" returns directly to ""Stonemilker's"" themes and mood. A sprawling ten-minute exploration of what went wrong, it occasionally explodes into storms of electronic percussion. It also includes some intriguing passages: ""You fear my limitless emotions, I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions."" The accusations also come out in full force: ""I did it for love, I honored my feelings, you betrayed your own heart, corrupted that organ"" and ""family was always our sacred mutual mission, which you abandoned."" Some fairly intense interludes punctuate the verses. A bittersweet string melody closes the piece. ""Family"" uses digital thumps and scrapes and an eerie ambience as a foundation for mourning the death of a family, potentially the already mentioned abandoned family in ""Black Lake."" A sonically surprising bridge then suddenly interrupts the murky dirge with bouncy staccato strings. This song may represent the acceptance stage of grief. Basically, it's over, bring on the funky strings.\n\n""Notget"" reaches a cathartic peak. Full of open throated lamentations such as ""love will keep us safe from death"" and ""I will not forget this notget, will you not regret having love let go."" The song succeeds phenomenally in portraying ominous emotions. It ranks as one of the album's most unforgettable moments. ""Atom Dance"" exudes the cosmic and molecular mood of ""Biophilia"" with plucking strings and lines such as ""I am fine tuning my soul to the universal wavelength, no one is a lover alone, I propose an atom dance."" Once again, the song quickly transforms with the voice of ANOHNI, who also dueted with Bjork on ""Volta."" Healing appears: ""we aim at peeling off dead layers of loveless love"" and ""when you feel the flow as primal love, enter the pain and dance with me!"" Then finally some signs of release appear: ""atoms are laughing at last."" ""Mouth Mantra"" hints at some kind of inexplicable verbal constipation. ""My throat was stuffed, my mouth sewn up, banned from making noise, I was not heard."" ""Quicksand"" departs somewhat from the album's underlying mood with percussion and digital giant wasp buzzes. The lyrics discuss ""our mother's philosophy"" which ""feels like quicksand."" Other interesting lines suggest energy sources to carry on: ""locate her black lake, the steam from this pit, will form a cloud, for her to live on."" This may provide an alternate to the less elegant line ""when life gives you poop, put it on your garden.""\n\n""Vulnicura"" presents yet another dimension of Bjork's continuing artistry. Yes, it feels safe to apply that dangerous and now almost quaint word to her work. She sits directly in the tradition of ""music as art,"" arguably traceable to the Beatles, that tries to push boundaries, to not simply repeat past successes, to explore and unearth new ideas, sounds and emotions. This album contains no instantly radio-friendly or easily accessible pop hooks. And that's a good thing. The airwaves have far too much of that already. The curious human brain needs to stray away from safe cultural havens at least once in a while, and Bjork's ever evolving music continues to provide such an oasis. She hasn't stopped either. Apparently fully past the pain of the breakup that inspired ""Vulnicura,"" 2017 will apparently see another new Bjork album titled ""Utopia."" The first single, ""The Gate,"" certainly points to another indescribable and endlessly fascinating collection of songs, not to mention more stunning surreal imagery. Slowing down certainly doesn't seem like an option for Bjork at this point. ""Vulnicura"" will probably end up as one more step on what hopefully remains a long journey."

In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.\n\nAll of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.\n\nWords Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After ""Promise Land,"" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven ""originals."" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric ""Blakk Soul"" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in ""Kings.""\n\nIt would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty."

The Dave Clark Five started as the Dave Clark Quintet, the history going back to 1957, which is important as far as Beatles comparisons.  While historians rightfully put The Beatles at the top of the heap from this amazing decade, we would be remiss (and wrong) to assume there weren't other outfits who were no clones at all, and doing equally fabulous work of their own.  The U.S. had The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons - Britain of course gave us the fabled British Invasion, with tons of clones of the Beatles, but a few that were genuinely the real deal.  Most folks will probably agree that The Yardbirds and The Dave Clark Five were the top of the line competitors to the Fab Four, although The Yardbirds, who boasted Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as lead guitarists, were setting the stage for heavy music, especially after Jeff Beck split to form the Jeff Beck Group, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.\n  The DC5 were more pure rock and rollers, and they knew their stuff!  This album was available just in the last few weeks for about $25, so I'm surprised the price has jumped up again.  Dave Clark committed one of the biggest blunders in rock history when, after the band broke up in 1970, he saw fit not to release any material at all until after 2000, by which time LP's had worn out, there were probably very few cassettes, and they don't last either, and radio stations dropped them after their copies were too beat up to play.  This meant a generation would come and go before the public got to hear them again, and by that time only those who were teens in the '60's even knew who the DC5 even were.\n  A splendid PBS documentary did raise awareness, including mine, and although I had heard them before, I had not paid much attention.  I'm glad I did now, because they were great.  Tons of hits here include ""Glad All Over"", ""Any Way You Want It"", ""Sha Na Na Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"", which is much tougher than the more watered down version usually played on the radio, and other great songs that bristled with energy and great playing throughout.  It is interesting to speculate what may have happened had this amazing band continued and started forging new sounds.  They were already tough as nails, so they could have been big time hard rockers with more guitars.  Unfortunately we will never know.\n  But for those who love real genuine rock and roll at its best, and want to hear what other outfits from the Beatlemania years sounded like, you really owe it to yourself to check out the Dave Clark 5."
"16606","5","","B00SYUF8O6","66fe3175c19cb7c7cebe597e051296a8KMJ2","I pulled this CD out of my shelf the other day and the songs were just as good as I remembered from when I purchased this back in 2010. Songs such as ""Do you Love Me"", better than the Contours version and the best version I've heard, ""Glad All Over"", ""Bits and Pieces"", ""Can't you See That She's Mine"", both songs titled ""Everybody Knows"", ""Catch Us If you Can"", ""I Like It Like That"", ""Because"" and the previously unreleased ""Universal Love"", which has the same corde progression as Marmalade's ""Reflections Of My Life"". Also loved the lowd haunting ""Ninteen Days"", a nice blues rock song about being lonely. ""Everybody Knows (We're Through"" was covered by Engelbert Humperdinck and both versions are great. Sadly I got rid of the imbossed outer box to this package. I happily have the 28 page booklet included, but I am not fond of the liner notes here because it makes Dave Clark sound very selfish. It only mentions stuff about him and no other band members. I was expecting that to happen as he is a really greedy selfish man who always resists the chance to keep his albums available on CD. When he passes away, there is a better chance of more CD reissues as the masters will be lisenced to his family and maybe we'll see them on CD in the future. I don't really want to say this, but hurry up, Dave and die! so your fantastic music becomes available forever on CD."

This ""departure"" CODA struck all the right chords with me concerning the passing of a stellar mostly lately under-rated artist. More young people and typical modern"" country"" and/or ""rock and rollers"" need to check out Glen's history and learn from a master. The man was an innovator and a foundation stone of American popular music. I remember watching the Glenn Campbell hour back in the 60s-70s and he always had the coolest acts, so it brought our family together in front of the TV on those nights.  9 times out of 10 my mostly traditional country music DAD would give a nod of approval to what we were listening to, simply because Glen had them on his show, that was a HUGE stamp of approval. Let me just ask you, what music program of the modern era (right now) brings families together like this? This was way before MTV so we didn't suffer from lack of video of our favorite up and coming artists in those days, thanks to Glen's vision. NO he is not a relation to me (that I am aware of) but every CAMPBELL in this family is proud and always loved Glen and not just for his name. Glen Campbell made beautiful, inspiring and memorable moments, not just music!"

You have a mixture of dance beats, rap lyrics, rock music and so forth so if your a true fan of the Undead then pick this CD up, like many have been saying sound too mainstream but like any singers composers got to mature and move on with their music like I said in a pervious review they lost the main singer and replace with Danny.  I personally enjoy all but one song and that's saying lot for a music CD and my taste in music.

I kind of had a falling out with the band then, made a little bit of an effort to get into Circuital, but I had resigned myself to never hearing much of the soaring, celestial mystery you hear in classics past. Its cool for a band to evolve, sometimes you just evolve in a different direction than they do. No biggie.\n\nThe Waterfall is more of a continuation of my glancing interest in what they're up to, combined with a fatalistic pessimism that weve seen the very best they can do so far.  There are some tracks here, however, that are not only among their very best, but take the bus in a strange new direction that was unforeseen, intriguing, and rather dark in a good way. The first order of business is to get past the first two tracks, which are embarrassingly bad and borderline rival even the most cheeseball moments of Evil Urges.  Believe has absolutely nothing to say and nowhere to go, and Compound Fracture wallows in genericness, a real stinker.  But from there on out, prepare to get your wig blown back by a band on a mission, with the next two tracks being back to back classics, incorporating a wide-eyed, almost childlike wonderment, flirting with the listener, an exhausting journey that reaffirms they are capable of still producing some astounding music. Putting the hypnotic qualities of repetition to use on Like the Rivers middle section and The Waterfalls insistent vocal hook, you honestly don't want those two songs to end. Spring finally does something mysterious and uncharacteristic with Jim James obsession with dance rock, and Thin Line and Tropics throttle way up on a soulful groove that feels startling, uncomfortable, real.\n\nMy high expectations for a real fine closer were dashed, and the album lands where it started at jammy mediocrity. I suppose the one thing we can always expect from My Morning Jacket from now on is inconsistency... Ill take it."

The main theme recurrent throughout most of the tracks was very similar to the main theme that Masashi Hamauzu used for his Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.  Although somewhat beautiful, the Ori theme so heavily recalled Hamauzu's earlier work that I was unable to enjoy it.  The tracks seemed like remixes of FF13's ""The Promise"" and ""Serah's Theme,"" and it was impossible to dissociate one from the other.\n\nIf Gareth did this by accident, having never been aware of Hamauzu's work, what a dreadful happenstance!  I hope such a mistake never happens to him again--no doubt many composers worry that they might inadvertently seem to be plagiarizing, when they really were not doing so."

The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.\n\nMaking beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. ""Want Something Done"" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and ""Contradiction's Maze"" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds."

With these Impeccable sonics and performances recorded here, we get to enjoy the full depth of the solo piano experience. ' Once Upon Impossible ' is a true gem and standout with it's ethereal haunting vocals . Bravo Fiona !"
"16900","5","2","B00U67IOI2","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Signature - Solo"" is Fiona Joys long-awaited (by me, anyway!) first solo piano album, and what a beautiful surprise it is! Produced and recorded by Cookie Marenco, founder of Blue Coast Records, Signature is being released in several formats. (My review copy is a standard CD, but the sound quality is still amazing!) A classically-trained pianist from Australia, Fiona Joy has created an impressive collection of recordings beginning with her 2004 release, Portrait of a Waterfall as Fiona Joy Hawkins. Some of her more recent albums were recorded at Imaginary Road Studio and co-produced with Will Ackerman, who refers to Fiona Joy as one of the brightest lights in contemporary instrumental music. Signature was recorded on an 1885 Steinway piano, and every nuance comes through in breathtaking clarity. The album features a solo version of Grace, which was included in the 2014 Grammy winning ""Winds of Samsara"" by Ricky Kej and Wouter Kellerman, and a duet version of Once Upon Impossible that features Lawrence Blatt on acoustic guitar as well as Fionas ethereal vocals. Nine of the ten tracks are purely solo piano at its colorful, expressive best.\n\n""Signature - Solo"" begins with Ceremony, a lively, upbeat piece that sets the tone of the album and tips listeners off that this is no ordinary solo piano album. Grace is likely to become one of Fiona Joys signature pieces, as it occasionally refers to some of her earlier pieces that haven't been as widely heard as her more recent work. Its a wonderful piece as either a piano solo or an ensemble piece, but I really love the solo version. The melancholy Fair Not has a flowing left hand that gives it a subtle energy. Dark and very expressive, this is somewhat different from much of Fionas other music. There are two versions of Once Upon Impossible - a piano solo that is poignant and heartfelt, and the second that includes Fionas vocals and light guitar accompaniment by Lawrence Blatt, a fine artist/composer in his own right. Both are exceptional. Calling Earth is a somewhat shortened version of Earthbound from ""600 Years in a Moment."" Invisible Train is my favorite track. High energy and very spirited, I hope sheet music is planned for this one! The elegant title track is slow, pensive and very heartfelt - gorgeous! As its title suggests, From the Mist is cool and has no hard edges - very fluid and free, colored in muted shades of gray and blue. Little Star concludes this very special album with a sweet and tender piece that tells its story simply and without a lot of embellishment.\n\nI truly hope this is just the first in a series of solo piano albums from Fiona Joy. Her elegant touch and soulful playing have always made her one of my favorites. I have been fortunate to have Fiona Joy perform two house concerts in my home, so I have been able to watch her play several times - always a treat that needs to be shared! Very highly recommended!"
"16901","5","","B00U67IOI2","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","Among the things that distinguish Australian pianist/ composer Fiona Joy in the genre of new age music is her commitment to releasing her music on a wide variety of formats including super high fidelity audiophile recordings. This album was Fiona's first on the Blue Coast Records label run by award winning producer/ recording engineer Cookie Marenco who worked extensively on this project at her San Francisco Bay area studio. While Fiona often performs as a solo pianist, her previous releases have featured many well-known studio musicians in the course of her recording sessions with Windham Hill Records founder and GRAMMY winning producer Will Ackerman. However, as the title indicates, the new Fiona Joy release is primarily a solo piano recording.\n\nThe album features Fiona's original composition ""Grace"" which also appears as a large ensemble version on the ""Winds Of Samsara"" CD by Ricky Kej and Wouter Kellerman, which recently won the GRAMMY in the new age category. A track entitled ""Once Upon Impossible,"" which Fiona describes as: ""love that has tried its hardest but cannot work,"" appears in two versions on the album, one as a solo piano, and one as a duet with guitarist Lawrence Blatt, who is the sole accompanist on the album. The duet version also features Fiona's airy Enya-like vocals. One of my favorite songs was ""From The Mist,"" which draws from Fiona's Irish and Scottish roots. It is especially significant to her since it was co-written by her father.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the emotional range and diversity that emanates from her heart and soul into her fingers as they dance on the keyboard.  Fiona's composing and piano artistry and are like a rainbow reflecting the colors of the spectrum. Each tonal shade draws the listener in to what she is feeling and expressing. But no matter what the mood, anything that Fiona plays is marked by an elegance and aesthetic that is evocative and inspiring. In her own words: ""You will hear my feelings in these songs; they are dedicated to saving that small place in everyone's heart, the place where fairytales linger, and where we find the strength to meet our reality...with grace."""

The thirty-seconds per song that Amazon lets you hear on their preview pages are just about the length of time that you get on the final exam to identify the names of these songs.\n\nSo, if you have the money to spare (the price is better than right), buy this and other ""History of"" CD's. If you don't have the money to spare, you can still listen to the thirty-second snippets as often as you like for free, and use them to ""ace"" your ""Music Appreciation"" class.\n\nI highly recommend dthis ""History Course"" to you.\n\nJohn"

Vox recordings from that era were typically a bit tinny, probably because they thought nothing of putting 30 minutes of music on one side of an LP.  Most of these recordings are better than that, but some are lacking.  The performances are a bit more schmaltzy and slower in tempo than the more recent recordings of Rachmaninoff I've heard.  The Symphonic Dances are my favorite among these recordings.  Pretty good, but there are other recordings of S R's work that I prefer.  A good value for the price which is what Vox tends to sell."

Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.\n\nTheir second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.\n\nDespite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop."

The intricacies of the piece are portrayed in such deep detail. A day like no other and Nunus sunrise are way up in the top drawer  On Liberty one can feel free, and the reason could be the season, a situation or just about anything!!! Meadow comes across with a more pastoral, calm feel, while When the trees fell has a melancholic narrative air about it. The title track Fire in the rainstorm brought to mind scenes and images of resilience, steadfastness in the eye of adversity!! Mind blowing music and mind blowing feel captured in the best conceivable way possible!! "
"17279","5","","B00VNAU3CG","b8831f3d21a11d987a1664b4459a8d92A2G9","Ive rarely heard solo piano sound this amazing! The shades through legato, staccato, pianissimo and fortissimo are played with fine distinction. Its the ideal record to play when you're meditating or ruminating on your thoughts. The title track FIRE IN THE RAINSTORM is deep and WHISPER OF THE HEART has a thought-provoking aura about it, and WINTERS END asks a question- what next?"
"17280","5","3","B00VNAU3CG","a22c18f8ec32767edf3b6ca76be4e6c6QDJQ","So, what is the sound and soul of this intriguingly titled album? Ill start our by saying that the sound quality is as exquisite as you could expect being produced by GRAMMY wining producer and Windham Hill Records founder Will Ackerman and engineer Tom Eaton along with pianist/ composer Kori Linae Carothers. The highly modified Steinway piano at Wills Imaginary Road Studios is legendary and has provided the instrumental voice of numerous outstanding pianists over the years. The opening track, A Day Like No Other, touched me emotionally right from the start with its dreamy and slightly wistful melody. I appreciated the sense of dynamics in Koris playing  knowing when to lean into it and when to lay back, as well as finding the balance between notes and space. This blend of technique and feeling, for me, is one of the hallmarks of a great musician.\n\nI was curious as to what the title track would sound like given its enigmatic name. It turns out to be quite descriptive as the notes in the opening movement fall from her fingers like the first drops of rain in a summer shower. As the composition evolves, the flames are fanned about two thirds of the way through. However, again, the sense of dynamics I spoke of earlier is evident, and just as a fire needs oxygen to exist, there is breath within the blaze as she pulls back momentarily to provide some air and a release from the buildup. The maturity and level of expression in Koris playing are impressive.\n\nThe ability to communicate stories and emotions in her music is a gift that she is eager to share with the world. Kori Carothers is truly an inspiration, both as a recording artist/ performer as well as in the example she has set in her life becoming a professional musician in spite of being deaf in one ear. She encourages others not let anything deter one from following their dreams and pursuing their passion in life. Fire In The Rainstorm is an eloquent artistic statement from a highly regarded pianist/composer whose music resonates with heart and soul."
"17281","5","","B00VNAU3CG","5d8b8c9bb934d6872d4f9daadc443cb2Q3W0","""Fire in the Rainstorm"" is Kori Linae Carothers second project with Will Ackerman producing, and her first solo piano album. It is her fourth album to date and contains twelve original pieces. With one of the more dramatic album covers of the year, the music is both eloquent and beautiful, fueled by grace and passionate emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed Koris first recording with Ackerman, ""Trillium,"" but it is amazing the depth and honesty that is often revealed when an artist goes it alone with just the piano. Such is the case here. It is interesting to note from her bio, that Kori is deaf in one ear and was told as a child that she would never be a musician. She continued her music studies through high school and college, proving the naysayers to be completely wrong. In a way, she has come full circle and is now donating a percentage of the sales from ""Fire in the Rainstorm"" to Hearing Health Foundation.\n\nThe album opens with A Day Like No Other, a dreamy and slightly melancholy piece that also expresses determination and hope - a lovely way to begin. Flowing and lyrical, it grabbed my attention right away! Nunus Sunrise was composed as a loving tribute with warmth and strong emotions. Its really interesting how the piece starts to slow near the end and then just fades out, unresolved - kind of like life does sometimes. Meadow is a favorite with its relaxed, carefree mood and easy grace. Tidal Rift is a beautiful, heartfelt piece inspired by the ups and downs in relationships - another favorite. The title track is a passionate piece written for a friend whose life has been full of turbulence. The piece begins calmly, gradually building in intensity and drama - very powerful! The Day is a tribute to those who lost their lives on 9/11. Originally recorded as an electronic piece on Koris first album, ""The Road Less Traveled,"" its a poignant and tender piano solo - another favorite. The Kindly Beast is especially touching, knowing that Marvin, Koris beloved dog, died recently. He followed her everywhere and liked to get in the way of her hands when she was playing the piano (Ive had the same problem with my cats!). Marvins playful antics will live forever in this song. Whispers of the Heart is a stirring tribute to friends and family who stand by through lifes trials and joys. Buoyant yet deeply emotional, its a beauty! When the Trees Fell mourns the loss of a giant tree with five trunks that was taken down by a huge storm. Grief and loss flow throughout this gorgeous piece, ending the album with a sigh and a tear.\n\nKori Linae Carothers has really come into her own with ""Fire in the Rainstorm."" I hope it brings her the fans and recognition she so deserves! Very highly recommended!"

Besides being almost painfully traditional for the duo, Lessons includes all new verse-material and original beats, which are conventional and come from an assortment of credible producers (Ayatollah, Hazardis Soundz, Beatz N Da Hood, etc). Their Queens homie and long time collaborator, Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), plays a major and perhaps excessive guest-part and is joined by fellow features Royal Flush, The LOX, Anna Shay and Raekwon. Overall, these are loaded spots but uninteresting in their predictability. Capone and Noreaga do convey some different feelings in addition to hardcore street angst (the madness of ghetto crime in many instances of course, homie-love in ""U.M.A.R"" and lady-love in ""Chinese Girl"" for example) but they're in virtually the same format as all their previous releases. With low relevance, so-so rapping and outdated gangsterism and style, Lessons is a dwindling project from the emcees, whose peak is most likely behind them at this point."

Overall, she took a step further within her voice, and tried to make a new step in her musical legacy. She went to Warner Brothers, and with the release The Light Of The Sun, she did come back with her song Shame with Eve, and it really did give her a new breath of fresh air in her songs and her musical dynasty. But trying to follow-up what made her brilliant, hasn't been a big leap for her with her Woman album. I found that some of the song didn't ignite the way that songs like Golden and A Long Walk did from her career. Fool's Gold, the lead from Woman wasn't actually a huge song for Jill. But still, it is better than the lackluster songs that she released the passed few years. It is alright, and at least it is better than the joke songs that Beyonce' and Rihanna have came out with. Still, it is alright, and a noble download for any new Jill Scott fans, but not quite for die hard fans of her gold.\n\nSong: C"

I suppose I held off writing a review because I vacillate on how I feel.  I still don't feel it's in the same league as ""Synthetica"" (reviewed separately) & ""Fantasies"", which you know you love on first listen!  Other reviewers have noted PAGANS is more eletro/synth. than others, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  When I do go electronic, I still enjoy hearing guitar(s) too, especially a strong bass line and strong drums.\n\nPAGAN'S opening track, ""Lie, Lie, Lie"" is a terrific one! which would be quite at home on either of the aforementioned METRIC CD/LP's.  Track #3 ""The Shade"" has that ethereal, haunting beauty and is quite good, as well as Track #7 ""Too Bad, So Sad"" which almost reaches a ""Youth Without Youth"" tone, while Track #5 ""Cascades"", another favorite, veers into an almost Depeche Mode/New Order sound.  Track #4 ""Celebrate"" isn't as likable, for me, having an EDM (electronic dance music) quality.  While I enjoy some EDM, I just feel METRIC defies genres, mixing & blending expertly to form their unique sound.\n\nI agree that PAGANS IN VEGAS is definitely more of an electronic release.  Aside from some odd zappy eletro-synth. sounds on some tracks,  PAGANS IN VEGAS, while different from earlier releases, is a strong grower!!!  P.S. Upon some research, I've learned METRIC'S newest release is scheduled for late September!!!  Upon hearing first single ""Dark Saturday"" (fantastic!), if that's representative of the whole I'll be captivated with what may possibly be METRIC'S Finest!!  In the meantime, there's plenty of dazzling METRIC music to keep listeners ears happy!!"

From the very first drum beats on track one it is apparent that the vinyl shreds the CD version for sound quality. Beautiful deep, rich, analog sound and awesome to have these great live songs captured. I've listened to the first 8 sides and not a warp to be found. In fact, amazingly not even the slightest tick, pop, or crackle. Absolutely dead quiet on the lead ins and just a super high quality pressing. The book with the song by song descriptions by Tom Petty himself is just icing on the cake. Stellar release! One note, there apparently was an error using the original hype stickers listing 180g vinyl. These in fact weigh in (by other reports I've read) in the 150-160g range and are not 180g vinyl.

They're very talented & innovative, changing-it-up song by song (not only from one release to another) keeping your interest piqued!  I did go in reverse, getting ""In Your Own Sweet Time"" first (reviewed separately) & do like that one better, but I do like EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED!\n\nTrack #1 ""Me and the Devil"" and Track #3 ""Baby Don't You Lie to Me!"" have a similar sound & they're both highlights.  Track #6 ""Dogtown"" is a little weird.  It begins sounding a bit like a faster Beatles' ""Come Together"", but then goes into what reminds me of 'circus music' & both repeat through song.  That 'circus' music I find more than a little odd & for me the song would have been one of my favorites on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED without it - But, again, name of the game for The Fratellis seems to be experimentation & with that, some will work exremely well & some not at all.  And, they have many more in the ""works extremely well"" category!!  Track #2 ""Imposters"" (Little by Little) doesn't work for me, although it does showcase their variety, once more.  Guitar's much too ""twangy"" a.k.a. country-western for me.  Track #8 is a really pleasant, beautiful ballad & jumped into a favorite immediately, which is a complete surprise for me, since I don't usually care much for ballads & by 2018, that's a particularly nice revelation! On Track #9 ""Getting Surreal"" The Fratelli's pump it up a notch!\n\nI didn't go with the deluxe version, because even on my most favorite recordings, I don't appreciate acoustic so much.  I imagine EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED is a must-have for Fratellis fans & I think it's an excellent jumping-in point for newcomers, as there's something enjoyable for everyone.  I would liken The Fratellis, especially on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED to a 21st Century Dire Straits, as they were uber-successful completely disregarding (1980's) trends & doing their own exceptionally talented thing.  The Fratellis don't sound like Dire Straits...the similarity lies in bucking trendy music, having a vast, devoted following & being hugely popular & successful!"

When I had heard so many songs, I can tell whether or not the sampled song works much better. That very rarely works, especially in R&B when artists like Maze or the great Whitney Houston whom did it very well, because they showed colors can be blossom in R&B. But in pop, that doesn't work so easily. When I first heard Halsey, it really didn't seem like it was anything special. Then, I went back to her music, after I heard one of her songs, which was sampled by Coldplay and Beyonce' for Hymn For The Weekend. Halsey's New Americana was the song they sampled, and listening to it, it was very dark but took a very tough stance on how the younger Americans have not been recognized for the past several years, and with people like Donald Trump whom made them look like there voices never existed. It isn't a bad song, but yet there are other ones that sounded much better taking a stance with he next generations in society around.\n\nSong: C 1/2+"

I recently decided to give Audiomachine ""Life"" a chance. I enjoyed several of the pieces. But I knew that was a lighter album and wanted to hear something that represented Audiomachine's more characteristic style and sound. I randomly chose Magnus this morning and have been listening to to most of the day. All I can say is I am amazed how good the music. I feel silly for waiting so long to try them out. Some of the pieces that really stand out to me as captivating and amazing at this point include Frozen Synapse, When it all Falls Down, Being Alive, Red October...these are the ones I appreciate so much just after one day. If you like epic music such as Two Steps from Hell, don't be a noob like me, buy this album.\n\nEdit: after listening for about a week I can say there are no duds on this album, every piece is exceptionally good and captivating. I cannot believe I waited so long to check out Audiomachine. Buy now. Bye now!"

I was skeptical that I would have any interest in Audiomachine's foray into epic, orchestral scores.\n\nBut then someone added a few tracks from Audiomachine's album to a youtube playlist and I found myself looping the same songs over again. War of Faith, Sura, Being Alive, just to name a few. I wanted to know more of who the artist was that composed these songs and lo and behold it was from Audiomachine's Magnus album which is absolutely stupendous.\n\nTake for instance War of Faith. The song starts with a slow, almost imperceptible build where you're wondering if you set the audio levels correctly on your device. Then you hear the pianos, the strings, a flourish of cymbals, and all of sudden you're hit with powerful vocals. I was left closing my eyes, bobbing my head, listening to this track over and over until I had to force myself to move onto another song.\n\nSo when I saw that there were 23 tracks left in the playlist, I couldn't help but grin. Magnus is an excellent compilation of orchestral scores and should be a MUST HAVE to any fans of epic, instrumental music."

Astonishing!, the new collaboration album between Mello Music Group producer L'Orange and Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith, is that it comes on the heels of their ""Sometimes I Feel"" joint from Mello Music's wondrous Persona LP so either they built off the creative spark of the song or an album was already in the works and they just wanted to give a sneak preview. No matter how it came about, it's still a dope album. L'Orange has once again put together a breathtaking spread of old time noir beats over which his compadre Keith raps science and swagger with the help of some of their favorite emcee friends.\n\nAs a slick, fourth dimensional rambler, the Kool Keith we witness here is as sharp with his bizarre, fanciful techniques as he was at the height of his Dr. Octagon phase, randomly ad-libbing strange ecological findings in our present time period and in the future. In fact forget ""strange"" because some of the scenes Keith describes are straight up outlandish, some might say crazy even. He may not be the belly laugh inducing character he has been at times, but he sure is every bit the cool, meticulous field researcher of his doctor side, with a new specialty: time-traveling. Nowhere is this more evident than in ""Twenty Fifty Three (2053),"" ""I Need Out of This World"" and ""Upwards. To Space!"", three short glimpses into what is most likely the fate of humankind, or at least where these artists believe it to be headed.\n\nLet's not leave out L'Orange, a growing prodigy in his prime, who for all his skill at assembling his esoteric samples, vintage commercial clips and old movie-music loops still knows how to keep a beat with infectious hip hop drums akin to intelligent dance music. His beats are rapper- ready and at the same time, great all by themselves. Mad props must also go out to all the guests, for if not for them, Time? Astonishing! might just have been a short, sweet, two-man EP and nothing more. From top to bottom, they are J-Live, Mr. Lif, Open Mike Eagle, Blu, Montage One, DJ Trackstar, MC Paul Barman and MindsOne. Time? Astonishing! is alternative hip hop at its finest, and by beginning to explore the future of our species with intergalactic migration and cross-dimensional travel as possibilities, it certainly is venturing into unchartered territory, inside and outside of the music."

Featuring the Dekany Quartet and the Fine Arts Quartet, this splendid MP3 album contains nearly 24 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns string quartets, all brilliantly performed by the two ensembles mentioned above.\n\nThis MP3 VoxMegaBox Edition contains all of the string quartets in Haydns oeuvre, including some that are credited to him that he may not have composed. The works are placed in opus number order, from earliest to latest, so listeners can hear the progression of Haydns musical thinking and development over his many decades of composing in this genre.\n\nThe Dekany Quartet plays just over half of the 70-plus works that appear on this album, and the Fine Arts Quartet plays the remainder. The musicianship of these two ensembles is exquisite throughout. They consistently engage their instruments in those finely balanced musical conversations that make well-played string quartets such a joyful listening experience for me. Their interpretations are flawless, showing every bit of the emotion and intellect that Haydn wrote into each one of his chamber music masterworks. There are some subtle differences between the two ensembles in tone, texture, and color, but overall, I find it difficult to tell them apart.\n\nThe audio quality on Haydn: Complete String Quartets is crisp, clean, and precise. My ears can easily detect each of the four lines playing in every string quartet. On rare occasions, the first violin sounds a trifle over-bright, but this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Haydn: Complete String Quartets first came out at Amazon.com in 2015, it apparently sold for $2.99  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at over three times that price ($9.49), I think it remains one of the best classical music values to be found anywhere. Its low price, combined with its exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality, makes it a must-have in every digital classical music library. Most highly recommended."

It came out between my sophomore and junior year in high school and caused me to break a bad habit so I could go after a girl I met in my sophomore English class. Unfortunately (or fortunately) in my junior English class I realized that her beautiful blonde hair was courtesy of Madam Clairol when she went too long between visits to Madam Clairol. But this song has stuck with me forever and I have applied it several women since including the young woman who became my wife who was such a non-Clairol Blonde when we first met that I did not believe she was not a Clairol Blonde for several months. We were never closer than 150 miles during our dating/courtship until we got married. Summers were were much further apart. So this song has a LOT of meaning for me."

"17773","3","","B00YZRT18G","1cbee52762bdf742a5f42f373408d79fNDLT","Over four albums, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have passed from their folk-rock beginnings to Potter wielding her open-E-tuned Gibson Flying V through stadium-stompers rockers like Paris (Ooh La La) and The Lion the Beast the Beat.  Midnight continues this trend with Hot to the Touch, Alive Tonight, and the rebel-yell Instigators.  However, rumors are that Potter fired The Nocturnals halfway through the album, relying much more heavily on collaborative writing with producer Eric Valentine  who also played nearly all the instruments on Midnight.  This insular approach resulted in quite a number of tracks that don't sound as fully developed as they might have been with input from a fully experienced band.  The drum-machined Delirious sounds like a Gloria Estefan knockoff.  The melody of The Miner bears more than a passing resemblance to Paul McCartneys My Love.  And Your Girl is Prince without the prance.  Lyrically, nothing on Midnight carries the soulful fire of Potters biggest ballad Stars, from her previous album The Lion the Beast the Beat.  If Nobodys Born with a Broken Heart is supposed to be poetically profound, Potters romance with Valentine has clearly weakened her critical judgment as a writer.  And while Potter remains in fine voice, the diminished influence of The Nocturnals leaves Midnight a mixed bag of tricks."

The answer is a resounding yes. This series takes place in a make-believe town of Vinci in Los Angeles (very close to the image of the town of Vernon) and is an anthology series in which police investigations unearth the personal and professional secrets of those involved, both within and outside the law. The players include Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Vince Vaughn, Taylor Kitsch, Kelly Riley, David Morse, Lolita Davidovich, Abigail Spencer and a host of others.\n\nThe tie in to this show is the often focused background guitar playing of Lera Lynn whose contributions could not be more impressive. Especially this song My Least Favorite Life. It rings as true as the stunningly intelligent dialogue. A fine script, suberb cast and direction, and the gift of Lera Lynn. Super! Grady Harp, July 15"

"17878","5","","B010DE0HS2","52d38fe63e8025a89819d54004ebb057KETS","This is a score that I've been waiting to get a CD copy of since the movie was released.  It jumps around in price and it sat in my wish list until it dropped reasonably enough for me.  The album cover looks different from what they are currently showing on Amazon but I actually like the CD cover better which has the silver Terminator skull (with red eye) against a black background.  Call me crazy in this digital age but I still prefer to purchase my music on CD.\n\nThis is my third score by Lorne Balfe.  I've previously enjoyed his work on ""Blackwood"" and ""Sons of Liberty"".  Balfe is part Hans Zimmer's score production company known as Remote Control Productions.  It is home to quite a few composers who are mentored by Zimmer and he often collaborates with many on various projects.  After hearing the past few Terminator scores and not really finding them that interesting, I had high hopes that this one by Balfe would finally bring the scores back from the past and into this future.  I am happy to say that this one certainly does just that.  Lorne Balfe successfully pays tribute to Fiedel while also developing his own themes and style to the score.  Fiedel's epic themes can be heard in a few cues like ""Better Days"" (track 2), ""It's Really Me"" (track 12), and most prominently in ""Terminated"" (track 22).  Balfe's interpretation of the theme in the last track is really outstanding and it's something that fans have been waiting for.\n\nBalfe has created his own original score but you can hear hints of the classic Terminator sound throughout the music.  The composer achieves this through his use of similar keyboard effects, percussion, strings, and heavy brass instrumentation that he spins & weaves into a sound that becomes distinctively familiar to fans of the iconic music from the early films.  To Balfe's credit, he does not merely give us only a repeat of that which has already been done, but he also develops new themes and electronic ""riffs"" of his own that are quite enjoyable.  I really liked the thematic music in track 11, ""John Conner"" and I also enjoyed the new and unusual electronic sounds found in ""Family"" (track 17).  There are few cues that give Balfe a chance to slow things down a bit like ""Sarah & Kyle"" (track 5) and ""Alcove"" (track 13) but this is largely an action heavy score.  Like Fiedel's previous scores, however, I found this one to be full of interesting effects, sounds, rhythms, and ambience that makes for an entertaining listen.  I like scores that allow you to mentally picture a scene and I would say that this one does just that.  Listening to pieces like ""Sacrifice"" (19) does this quite well.  The big swooping crescendos as one character saves another and the almost angelic sounding strings praising the heroic deed can certainly give you the mental images found within the music.\n\nI had to wait a long time to finally get a copy of this but it certainly was worth the wait.  The CD contains 22 tracks and runs around 1 hour and 12 minutes.  There is a 12 page CD insert that contains track listings, production credits, orchestra credits, and a special thanks section from Balfe, Zimmer, and Paramount Pictures.  There are plenty of photos from the movie as well.  Some are two page spreads, full pages, and several smaller photos.  This a great score from Balfe and I appreciate the nod to Fiedel's music, as well as, the excellent original music too.  I recommend!"

I got pulled in after listening to their newest album, God Damn Evil, and all I can say about Fallen is...WOW!!!  What a great album!  Talk about addictive!  I can listen to this album over and over from start to finish.  Like I said, I'm new to Stryper, so older fans of the band might not see it the same way, but Yahweh is one of the most original sounding, amazing songs that I've ever heard.  The church-like ""Yahweh"" at the beginning followed by an incredible riff and then it just gets better from there.  I can't get that song out of my head.  My kids are getting tired of me singing it around the house (probably due to my ""singing"" more than anything).  But after that song, there are so many other great songs on here, such as Sorry, Lost, Big Screen Lies, King of Kings...you name it, they're all good.  Stryper isn't as heavy as many of the groups I listen to (Megadeth, Slayer, Kreator, C.O.C...to name but a few), but they more than make up for it in song craft and melody, not to mention an uplifting message (and some nice riffs to boot).  I really like this album and I'm finding myself really liking Stryper as well.  If you haven't listened to this yet...what are you waiting for?  Check it out!"

This much more casual, experimental, noisy and playful. Its strength lies in its off the cuff feel. It's less meticulously produced and cautious than the previous two and to my ears a welcome relief. I was about to give up on these guys thinking they were becoming slick purveyors of sensitive, ball less muzak and here they prove that they've got some imaginative things to say yet.

The irony in the album title is that that Love is a well-known shadow singer, having sung backups and harmonies for an array of artists including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Dionne Warwick, The Beach Boys, and even U2.  Her Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home) is a signature holiday staple, which she reprises each year in a NYC holiday show.  She appeared in 20 Feet from Stardom, the 2013 documentary on the lives of backup singers to the stars.  Love turns 76 this year [2017], and, if this album is any indication, shes about as far from a rocker and a shawl as one can get.  Among the Believers (a Van Zandt original) bangs open the doors, and 13 tracks later, Jesus Is the Rock (That Keeps Me Rollin) (another Van Zandt rant) takes the party home with an all-out gospel shout.  In between, new songs by Linda Perry, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Webb, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, and Bruce Springsteen give Love fresh material to make all her own.  The roots of rock and R&B lace through every song on the disc, giving new power to Loves girl-group origins.  But the hands-down highlight is Loves rip through River Deep, Mountain High, which should come with a warning  it will inspire impromptu air-mic moves that could be downright embarrassing, depending on where you hear this."

Musically, he has tried to rebound, after losing a massive lawsuit from Marvin Gaye's family in regards for Blurred Lines using one of Gaye's classics Got To Give It Up, and personally his life has been in shambles, with the end of his marriage to Paula Patton whom he had a falling out and lost his marriage a few years ago, and his song Get Her Back and his Paula album were massive failures. He has tried to bounce again with Morning Sun, which worked back to his classic sound nicely. His latest song which teams up with cheap rapper Nicki Minaj, whom she does not bring enough into the song, and instead makes it lose its shine for Robin. It is alright, but not a song that has longevity in star power, the way that Magic and Sex Therapy did. Hopefully, Robin will have better to get him back in the rebound.\n\nSong: C"

As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.\n\nPlease note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major."

"18195","4","","B013THM8PA","bf6338a70a154d69217462cf75871768D0Z3","Lately Ive been having a great deal of success in finding large compilations of classical music at unbelievably low prices. Ive been reading some uniformly glowing reviews of the Big Box albums from The Bach Guild, so I decided to purchase one to see if its as good as reviewers say it is.\n\nMy first choice was the Big Haydn Symphonies Box, featuring over nine hours of Franz Joseph Haydns symphonies, for only 99 cents. This MP3 album contains a quite impressive array of music from the composer known as the father of the modern symphony. Haydn composed 104 symphonies during his long lifetime, and 24 of them appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Symphonies Box. They range from his earlier light-hearted works, through his more impassioned Sturm und Drang middle symphonies, and on to his most famous later Paris and London symphonic masterpieces.\n\nThese are all very fine performances from the 1950s through the 1970s. They feature various world-class orchestras and conductors who seem to mostly hail from eastern Europe. These ensembles may not have been as renowned as many of their more famous western counterparts, but their artistry and musicianship are undeniably every bit as good. They consistently do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama of Haydns great symphonic masterworks.\n\nThere are two unfortunate technical flaws in Big Haydn Symphonies Box that prevent me from awarding this otherwise outstanding album my full 5-star rating. There is a short but noticeable high-pitched tone at the 1:19 mark of track 13. Although its not particularly bothersome, the albums engineers should have noticed and removed it. Also, the final movement of Symphony No. 90 is incorrect. Although the tracks metadata correctly lists it as Finale: Allegro Assai, the music is actually a duplicate of the first movement of Symphony No. 91. Again, the albums engineers should have discovered and eliminated this error.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, Big Haydn Symphonies Box is an excellent MP3 album that I enjoy listening to on a regular basis. Highly recommended."

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music.  Because Amazon allows you to sample nearly every song/album that they offer. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads.  Free songs...even free albums.  And more important than free. LEGAL.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music.  But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first.  No review will help you make a better decision than doing that.  I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned.  However, the freebie selection on Amazon is constantly changing, so by the time you read this review, it may have a price attached.  If you are only in the market for freebies, I can make that super easy!\n\nCurrent selection of FREE AMAZON SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nCurrent selection of FREE AMAZON ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free"

However, there are some that do miss the mark in its entirety. Rachel Patten has been one of those artists that has really came out of nowhere with her breakout song Fight Song this past year, that has really worked for her. But trying to follow it up, is more than met the eye overall. Rachel's song, Stand By You, the second single from her debut album Wildfire, isn't actually one of her better songs. I really didn't find the song to have the longevity that could've been shown beyond the words of the soul. I personally wasn't moved with this track at the spirit. Fight Song really was a song that grew on you. Hopefully, there will be more from Rachel down the road, and something that will make her more than a one-hit wonder in spirit.\n\nSong: C"

So far, I've listen to them on repeat for extended periods of time, one at a time, to get my feels.\n\nI believe Fatal Illusion was the first video (audio track) tease/release.  I like it around the :58 mark when it gets past its fills (Ellefson's bass is sweet). So from there until the end, it is just killer and guttural.  It got me excited to see what Megadeth (this version) would put out.\n\nThe Threat is Real reminds me of old school Megadeth. It doesn't have the classic step-down like Peace Sells or So Far, So Good(1986.1988), but sounds like it could fit with Youthanasia (1994).\n\nTitle track, Dystopia, has an updated feel for Megadeth. This doesn't always prove to be a good thing, but I think they nailed this one.\n\nMegadeth is one of my all-time favorite bands.  I was 'with' them since Killing is My Business...but I'm not the biggest fan after Risk.  I did come back for Thirteen, though. So, so far, Dystopia is lining up to be a solid album.\n\nI eagerly await the full release."

That album is also fantastic.\nThis record much like TLIL is using a singer that sounds nothing like RJD which is the absolute right way to go. I'm a fan of RJD and if they would have emulated him it would have been odd.\nCraig Goldy is an amazing guitarist along with a solid rhythm section. The drummer being Vinny Appice( he also plays on TLIL record) is simply one of the greatest drummers in hard rock/ heavy metal.\nThe vocals are done well by Chas West.\nI really wish the radio would play this stuff like in the good ole days when rock radio was cool.\nWe are all treated to very cool HR and HM these days, you just have to look for it. Don't depend on radio.\nThis album is as good as anything great back in the day.\nI usually don't point one one particular song in my reviews. But the track Path Of Love ( 7) is just outstanding. I listened to it on the way home from work and kept rewinding( showing my age, old cassette tape term for any young ones that may be reading this) and I don't do that very often. The keyboards, guitar, the hook and everything else about it is perfect. In the chorus there's a drop down sound when the vocalist sings "" and to sing my desperate song"".

He takes fairly swift tempi but doesn't rush and his Beethoven has plenty of spirit.\n  Bruce Hungerford's Beethoven #4 - OK, it's mono and an unnamed orchestra but this is the only recording of Bruce Hungerford performing a Beethoven concerto and it's quite good.\n  Mozart Piano Concertos - 6 are here in quite good to excellent performances.  I had the Denis Matthews #20 on LP and am only sorry it's discmate (#24) wasn't included in this collection.  There is one big question mark - see below.\n  Rachmaninoff #3 - a very fine performance by Vladimir Viardo (NOT Viarto), Eduardo Mata and the Dallas Symphony\n  Tchaikovsky #1 - a memorable performance by John Ogdon, Pierre Monteux and the London Symphony, recorded live in Vienna in 1963.\n\nGood performances:\n  Chopin #1 with Rosa Lhevinne\n  Brahms #2 with Peter Serkin - not great but his suits him better than #1\n\nProblem performances\n  Brahms #1 with Peter Serkin.  Sorry but I've always heard this as ""angry young man"" music, not disgruntled senior citizen, which is what comes across here.  My model for a Brahms #1 is the 1958 recording by Gary Grafffman, Charles Munch and the BSO - which not only has fire but also sounds a lot better than this effortful recording from about 25 years later.\n  Grieg & Schumann with Russell Sherman - These are sabotaged by poor sound.  The piano is all treble and the orchestra often sounds muddy.  Plus Joseph Silverstein's conducting cannot match Ormandy, Giulini, Reiner or many others in the Schumann.  The last movement of the Schumann doesn't dance it lurches.  There also seems to be a digital hiccup at the start of the 3rd movement.\n\nSaint-Saens and Liszt with Emil Gilels and Kiril Kondrashin - definitely sound their age.  Disappointing considering how well the Oistrakh Dvorak and Glazunov Violin Concertos of roughly the same vintage sound in the ""Big Violin Concertos Box"".\n\nThe obligatory Bach Guild Box errata list\n  As noted by others, the labels on the last movement of Mozart #21 and the Beethoven Triple were swapped.\n  As also noted by others, the ""Mozart #26, ""Coronation"""" is not that at all but the Mozart #27\n  Please BG, try to spell the performers' names correctly- the soloist in the Rachmaninoff is Vladimir Viardo\n\nMYSTERY - Who is performing the mislabeled Mozart #27?  I haven't been able to find a listing for a Peter Serkin recording of this work, even though BG gives him credit.  I've also looked for recordings of it by Bruce Hungerford, Howard Shelley and Russell Sherman but nothing turned up.  The Larghetto clocks in at > 10 minutes, which is about the most leisurely traversal I've heard.  Any guesses as to who we're hearing?"

This, however, is a really strong effort from the Cult.  I won't say it is an equal to their earlier albums (Love, Electric, or even Sonic Temple) but it is a really good album.  Better than their last two efforts.  These guys (Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy) invented ""alternative"" music.  Heavier than their New Wave counterparts, but more soulful, lyrical and smarter than heavy metal, the Cult have always been a bit of an acquired taste, primarily for those who are a bit more hip than the common trends in music.  I think that with Hidden City they solidify their status as Alternative Gods.\n\nBirds of Paradise, GOAT, Deeply Ordered Chaos and Dark Energy are unquestionable Cult classics, sitting just one notch below Love Removal Machine, She Sells Sanctuary, Rain and Sun King."

"18747","5","8","B017BBGFH2","9b351fe9c06e3d6df2683235d966b0a7LSAD","This release grew out of last years unexpectedly successful Renaissance Choral Music box, and our yearly Big Baroque Box. We moved further in time to the Baroque period - but we discovered that if we did a Big Baroque Choral Music Box, it would, generously put, be about 75 hours long (no exaggeration). But it is named as a follow up to the Renaissance Choral Box, so we can move into Volumes 3 and beyond (and we will). So we cut out for the time being Bach, Handel and Purcell, all composers who we have covered with their own individual boxes. And we still left out quite a bit.\n\nWhy did we leave hours and hours of recordings off of this box? Well, for this box, we wanted to focus on Bach Guild recordings that had been buried in the vault for a while. The two juicy nuggets in this box are a long-forgotten recording of Israel in Egypt - one of the first Bach Guild releases (BG 521 to save you the trip to your LP collection). Sung in German, this is a rare bit, and The Bach Guilds first recording of a Handel oratorio. The second juicy bit is a complete recording of Glucks Orfeo and Euridice, made in Vienna (one of the last Vanguard recordings made in Vienna) in the mid 1960s, with a superb cast and conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras (BG 686, stereo version BGS 70686). This was released on CD in the early 1990s but has been out of print for (we estimate) nearly 20 years.\n\nAlso getting their Bach Guild digital debuts are the wonderful recording of the Kraus Funeral Cantata for Gustav, the Charpentier Te Deum with Jean-Francois Paillard (with Maurice Andre playing trumpet in the famous opening movement) and several other Baroque choral and vocal works featuring Alfred Deller, Maureen Forrester and other well-beloved members of the Bach Guild roster.\n\nKudos to the executive producer of The Bach Guild for tireless work resurrecting the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus RV 594. We often have just bare threads of information on the older recordings, and hunting down the old LP (and this is the 11th LP The Bach Guild released) can be very difficult, although we do have an extensive library, we don't have everything. The information was sketchy and misleading, and we tried to include this recording in the Big Vivaldi Box but we really couldn't piece the work together. This time, we were able to locate a score and place the tracks in the proper order (the information we had actually indicates that this was a different Vivaldi Dixit (there are two). So this recording, probably out of print for 50 years is now featured, in all its glory. We cant confirm this, but this release probably represented the first complete recording of the RV 594. We put the release date as 1952 (original LP number: BG 678, in stereo as BG 70678 - we only had the mono master at our disposal).\n\nAnd snark aside, we meant glory as in loud and glorious. This collection does not feature any historically informed instrument-based performances. You will hear full-throated choirs, and the Vivaldi never gets performed like this in our era, so its a surprise and surprisingly beautiful to hear an operatic choir throw themselves into this work now essentially in the possession of much smaller early music groups (not that theres anything wrong with that, either way).\n\nAgain, theres a lot more we could have put inbut we tend to cap these at 10-12 hours (yikes). This one is 8 hours and 54 minutes. Thanks to all who contacted us for all the suggestions for repertoire in the past year."

He honestly has been one of the greatest singer/songwriters in regards to R&B music. Yet, he has been absent from making decent music for quite awhile. He came back from a long absence from making music for himself in regards to good music. He came back with Toni Braxton a few years ago, and they both released Love, Marriage & Divorce, which wasn't a bad record for the two of them. But for himself, he has needed to write better for his solo work. We've Got Love, which is the lead single from his latest album, Return Of The Tender Lover, isn't a bad song for die hard Babyface buffs, but overall not a must download for new fans of his music. The song does show his style nobly but not really anything to thrive into that ""wow, I must own this song"" factor. Still, he has had great songs before, like When Can I See You Again. But overall, there can be better from Babyface down the road.\n\nSong: C+"

John Lennon was extremely talented vocally in a different way than was Paul McCartney. John could wrangle you with his vocals or sing the loveliest love song.

I used to sit in our comfy brown swivel chair next to the stereo with the headphones on and read the lyrics and look at the gatefold photo. I'd sit there and wonder how the one kid got to be on the other side of the fence. And the kid in the middle looked sad and kind of out of place, but he seemed pretty cool, too. I always liked how Ringo was at kid height, all hunkered down. The lyrics to the songs were printed on the sleeves, so you could follow along. I really liked Paperback Writer because it told a story and I liked books, and it wasn't about girls and all that hold your hand stuff. The way the vocals cascade all over themselves from the top, and the way they echo around after writererererer....so trippy .The guitar riff is great, but i don't think I appreciated it at the time. I could also imagine the Monkees doing this one, my favorite lunch time entertainers. Anyhow, it's a fun Paul song. I don't think John would have written a song that began with 'Dear Sir or Madam.'"

I had a musical epiphany because I was really locked in to Paul's bass. It was almost like I was hearing it for the first time, especially on the fade out chorus. I'd always appreciated his playing, but this time it really hit me how great it truly is.\nI love when John's vocals take on that faraway hue on 'cellophane flowers...', it's like OK, Dorothy opened the door from her black and white world and entered the colorful land of Oz. Well, in this song, we start out already in Oz and on the cellophane part we open a door into an even more amazing land - John's imagination! This is psychedelic pop at its best. Alice in Wonderland, woooo!"

"19091","5","","B0198BDC7Y","221bd76ab1fdf78ecc135267f70815d8280V","I have been a die hard Beatles fan forever. There isn't too many things I can remember when I was 7 years old but I still remember watching The Ed Sullivan Show way back one Sunday night in February of 1964 when the Beatles appeared causing a sensation bringing Beatlemania from England across the Atlantic to the U.S. Their music was like nothing ever heard before and would influence songwriters and musicians to this day.\n\nTheir songbook seems to be endless from all the great hits they had during their time together. To try to list all their greatest songs would take too much time and space for this review. For me though even more time consuming would be trying to pick which is my favorite song by the Fab Four. Just too many outstanding tunes to choose from. Most times you could say my favorite Beatles song is whichever one of theirs I happen to be listening to at that moment. If on the other hand you were to ask me to come up with a top ten list of the Beatles best songs there is one song in particular that would in my book make it somewhere on that list, the song is ""Rain"". A really great Beatles song that is while a great one is little known and overlooked by many fans.\n\nOne reason is it never charted. It also never appeared on any of the Beatles albums. In fact it was released in 1966 as the B side to the Beatles hit single ""Paperback Writer"". This is however I feel a song that deserved to be the A side on any single. It has everything a great song needs insightful lyrics, great beat, great guitar work that combined grabs your attention.  This was recorded at the time the Beatles were transitioning their sound from the mop top ""She loves you yeah yeah yeah"" kind of music to being more experimental with their sound and creative with their words. For the true Beatles fanatic this is certainly one of their songs that has to be considered for download onto your iPod or smart phone."

This song has some really cool moments from Ringo and Paul; Ringo's quick rolls at :33 on 'into the shade' and at :45 in the way he extends the drum fill beyond the end of 'when the sun shines', and Paul's bass line at 1:18 during the 'I can show you' verse. And then at the end we get the 'let's play stuff backwards' moment. I always think John's vocals sound like 'still drippin on memory...' Bring on the April showers."

When they finally came back from their long hiatus with their self title in 2001 they have been cranking out new music by the boat loads. Unfortunatly while there have been hits like 'Keep Fishin', 'Pork and Beans' and 'Memories', their albums as a whole have been hit or miss at best. Their previous album really made me feel that they were coming back to their classic ways with a very strong album in 'Everything Will Be Alright in the End' Their new self-titled 'White Album' is a long miss from that level. The songs are not memorable and the album just does not resonate.\n\nI feel that like some of my other favorite bands this is another that I am just going to give up on when it comes to future releases. I feel that Weezer has left their mark on music but, there is no reason to stick around knowing that your band will not be forgotten. Best not to drive the rest of your loving fan base away."

Maybe if I'd have gotten the albums just prior to Howe's return I'd have a little more appreciation for this one.\n\nEDIT: I went back and purchased the previous 4 albums with Ronnie Monroe on vocals, and after listenening to them a few times chronologically, I felt I needed to revisit this review.  Unfortunately XI seems to be a bit of a step down in the songwriting dept when from the previous albums & I've deducted one star from my initial review.  Sorry guys, I know you can do better."

To me , this song is classic PSB with a firm foot on the ground of innovation. The single doesn't dissapont with a new radio mix of Say it to Me that has subtle musical additions to the original mix that up the urgency of the songs protagonist plea. The 2 b-sides are worth the price and the remix of Inner Sanctum punches up the beat for the dance floor. The Stuart Price mix of Say it to Me is fine. Overall I'm happy with this single and it's packaging."
"19144","3","","B01AB9Q2RE","d0ee2422a3fc531477c701d71bbb5ca1W4O7","The cd single has five tracks: Say it to me (new radio mix) which is just a shorter version of the album track with a bit faster beat/pace. Tracks 2 and 3 A Cloud in a Box and the Dead Can Dance are typical b-side tracks with the first being the better one by far. Finally track 4 is the Stuart Price  remix. The TRUE GEM in the cd version is the inclusion of an ultra rare (previous only available on a limited vinyl run) Inner Sanctum Carl Craig C2 Juiced remix that is made for the clubs and is a pure delight.\n\nThe three digital mixes should have been available on the cd version. The Offer Nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there. It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette forms.\nA Cloud in a Box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour. Say It To Me Stuart Price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there. It is the second-best version of all the remixes."

They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.  Highly recommended for anyone who is coming to the 3 Doors the first time."

Didn't recognize a few of the Iggy Pop tunes that show up on this live 2-CD / DVD title. Turns out that the tracks played at this gig are from the Igster's 'Lust For Life' ('77), 'The Idiot' ('77) and obviously his most recent work 'Post Pop Depression' ('16). Tunes I got the most out of were the previously mentioned ass-kicking ""Lust For Life"", ""Sister Midnight"", ""Funtime"", the awesome ""Nightclubbing"", the very recognizable ""The Passenger"" and ""China Girl"". Not to mention some material off the newest CD - like ""Gardeia"", ""Chocolate Drops"" and ""Paraguay"". Only downside here - maybe for some - is that I didn't see any Stooges classics covered. That's okay - it's all good just the same. The DVD has the very same track listing as the two audio CD's. Highly recommended."

"19167","3","2","B01AOP0Q2M","f630825e529f1e295464a6b6119eddd3G5S8","This is a rather difficult review to write, first because Im rather fond of Gaslight Anthem, and secondly because I dearly want to be inspired to like this solo project from Brian Fallon.\n\nIf theres one characteristic that Fallon carries around with him and refuses to let go of, its his penchant for spending too much time looking in his rearview mirror, over his shoulder, and his downright desire to be anyone other than who he actually is.  As to the rearview mirror aspect, if one listens to the mans lyrics on both the Gaslight Anthem albums and this solo outing, Brian seems to fear that his past is creeping up on him, and in so doing, that past is eventually going to catch up with him, and at that moment in time, hes going to have to come face to face with the present, the here and now, and his place in it.  When that time comes, Im sincerely hoping that his visions are focused on the future, because essentially there is nothing one can write about that happened a mere two hours in the past, over breakfast, so hes gonna have to face a future, and write about some things hed like to see happen, about dreams he longs to have come true, rather than resurrecting a past for which no one can do anything about.\n\nAs to him wishing to be someone else, on The 59 Sound, a song by Gaslight Anthem, he waxes longingly that he wishes he looked like Elvis, and then goes on to allude to Sam Space in Casablanca on the album jacket, while Gaslight has yet another song entitled Steve McQueen.  Of course wed all like to be someone other than ourselves at times  but theres a genuine difference between that, and not coming to grips with the fact that we are who we are.  Of course one could easily point to Springsteen when it comes to either of these aspects, yet Bruce wasn't so much living in the past, its more that he was revealing himself to us, telling us his stories, what made him who he is as he moved into the present.  And yes, one could certainly infer that Springsteens most interesting and beloved albums came from viewing his past.  And while thats all well and good, Bruce accepted those nostalgic characters, those struggling years, owing them, making them his own, while Fallon seems to be trying to out run them, as if by giving them voice, they will turn to dust, no longer being present to torment his mind.\n\nTheres no mistaking that Pain Killers obsessively belongs to Brian Fallon  its chocked full of idyllic images of an America that no longer exists, and probably never existed as Fallon has come to romanticize it; with that romanticization shading both the good and negative aspects of his plagued memories.  Frankly, Fallons become sort of a parody of himself, after all, how many girls named Maria, and how many times can he image a late night diner before actual cracks appear, and folks begin to think that they're hearing their the same old songs through a new set of speakers.\n\nI so wish that Brian Fallon would grasp the idea that even the losers get lucky some times [to paraphrase Tom Petty], because I actually like hearing the man sing, investing myself in his visions, and listening to his narratives.  Each song from Pain Killers feels as if the man is standing outside of not so much himself, but of real life, giving me the sensation that even as Fallon is holding faded photographic images, those images are bleaching in the sun, leaving him with only impressions of not only those images, but of his memory, where nothing can be trusted as truth.\n\nWith all that being said, Pain Killers is the sort of thing that draws me in, like a cheap pulp novel you read and leave on the seat of the crosstown bus when you're finished.  Nothing here is a keeper, but what Fallon does do is linger in my mind, where his memories mesh with mine, where I feel not so much alone knowing that Brian Fallon is out there reminding me that perhaps in this day and age, the past is not such a bad place to stake a claim.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler"

The songs have a flavor of the melody typical to classic hymns (major chords, simple do-re-mi scales, few key changes) rather than more freeform and jazzy tunes. This shows up best in ""Mother's Hymnal"" where you can hear someone paging through and playing bars of favorite hymns on the piano in the living room.\n\nI found ""Midnight in Moscow"" to be quite amusing--it's almost-not-quite a Russian folk tune, very dramatic and solemn.\n\nIf you have children, this is a fun thing to play for them, either at bedtime to relax and get ready for sleep, or to use to have them use their imagination and describe scenes evoked by each piece.\n\nCD was supplied by the composer in exchange for a fair review."

They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Bigger Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the second of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including a comprehensive offering of his piano sonatas, his only violin concerto, his complete Diabelli variations and piano concertos, four of his nine symphonies, as well as dances, songs, rondos, bagatelles, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Bigger Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I am slightly less enamored of it. This is mainly due to two reasons:\n\n1. There are no string quartets or piano trios on ""Bigger Beethoven Box."" Many of Beethovens greatest chamber music masterpieces belong to these two sub-genres, and I think the fact that  none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.\n\n2. The albums engineering is not quite as good as it is on other Big Box albums  especially Big Mozart Box and Big Haydn Box. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.\n\nDespite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Recommended."

Putting out nice albums like his latest, That's Hip Hop, makes it even harder. You can tell how great he would sound in the group again because his rhyme game is so tight here, and after all, he's obviously been working on it continuously. The Brooklyn backpack bomber comes off of 2014's House Slippers and 2015's Human with Illmind for this very retro, throwback-themed project, and it's got a lot of hardcore rap cats on it just doing their thing, with production that is true-to-the-pit boom bap. That's Hip Hop was released Tuesday, March 15 on the record label of the same name.\n\nThe album was clearly designed with the pure rap/rhyme addicts in mind. Like a typical Joell Ortiz set, it is not loaded with messages and really only aims towards a social end when Jo describes his urban N.Y.C. milieu and community across a handful of songs, when he tells a woman's sob story for her in ""Precious"" and when he tells some of his own war stories of hard times in ""Trouble."" Everything else is pretty much a lyrics-fest. Experienced, respected guys like Kool G Rap, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. start that good golden-era fire, and some neo-shine is cast by new jewels like Raven Felix, Chris Rivers and Token, the last of whom has a very double-edged verse in ""Kill at Will"" - it's very fast, very nimble and very impressive delivery-wise, but as insane rap mouthpieces tend to do, the search for meaning and message gets lost in his ravishing rapacious technique.\n\nJoell's well tuned machine-mouth works just fine here, but those offensive, shockingly controversial bits and pieces that all hip-hop heads know, love and look for are few in That's Hip Hop. Without making striking statements that are anti-status quo or anti-establishment, like he should, he depends on his striking yet easy obscenities and profanities to turn heads. And it was just like this on his last two albums as well. Many of us look to talented and skilled emcees like Joell to spread awareness about the world's problems, but sadly there's too little of that in the correct form here. Technically, Joell Ortiz is a beast and so are his features, and the producers have properly and impressively fashioned their beats into that vintage '90s style of hip-hop production, but if you're looking for new enlightening messages, you may not want to spend a lot of time on this disc."

Unfortunately, Chrisette Michele has been one of those songstresses that does deserve more credit because of her soul from the voice alone, but somberly she has never gotten it, in the severe overexposure of others like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, whom are more products than people. Hard to believe that it has been a decade since she came out of the bloom with her debut album, I Am, and she still has had better music than most of the jokes on radio today. Sadly, Chrisette has such a beautiful soul but she still never has gotten the credit she deserves with her work. Her latest single, tries to show that Chrisette is going for a more modern R&B sound that really does work in her favor, where she has had several songs from the past few years not work in her favor. Unbreakable, the lead single from her 5th album Milestone, is short and simple but shows she is still making better songs than what is out there in radio today. This is a nice download if you have followed Chrisette Michele for the past decade, and if you really enjoy her work.\n\nSong: B 1/2-"

While the past decade has brought her some ups and downs, with her own work, she is still holding steadily in her crafts. She has had some excellent albums with I Am and her second album Epiphany. But the later albums haven't been able to ignite in sales with Better and Let Freedom Reign, which had some songs that weren't up to par like The Goodbye Game and the haunting Charade, which was a real departure from her past works. She did come back soulfully with Together last year, but she is still trying to get back into the R&B game. Unbreakable, is definitely a good stepping stone, and shows a more edgier sound from Chrisette that mostly works to her own craft in song. While it isn't like Fragile was in song, it still is all Chrisette Michele. If you have loved her past work, you'll definitely be eager to hear what Chrisette has been up to.\n\nSong: B-"

Musically, it has been much harder to see one that will ignite afire in the way that groups like En Vogue and Destiny's Child had been able to do the past few generations. When Fifth Harmony came out the past few years, I honestly was not very thrilled at the songs that they had been able too come out with in heart and soul. I was not excited of the songs Sledgehammer and Worth It, which showed the gals were not very strong at the soul, and sounded more like they were little children at the mike for the first time than divas at the heart. Their latest single from their second album 7/27, tries to bring in more of a reggae feeling to their songs, but it didn't work overall. All In My Head (Flex) their latest single, doesn't actually deliver at the heart of the matter to what they really could've deliver, as a more sultry and seductive song to turn to the kids, into sultry songstresses. I really was not very impressed with the song, and hopefully, when the gals grow further into their music, Fifth Harmony will have much more down the road to sing about.\n\nSong: C-"

Musically, she has used her voice to strike back against her marriage to Gavin Rosedale abruptly ending in divorce. While she had drove well with her music, it is a far cry from her success when she used to be a part of No Doubt back in the 90's and early 2000's. Now, she is really on her own with a new relationship with singer Blake Shelton, and starting her life all over again. But with some tracks that I had heard from This Is What The Truth Feels Like, I wasn't completely impressed with the songs that she had already came out with the album. Misery, the third single from her album, isn't actually a strong and poppy song that really drove in the way that she had from her earlier solo songs like The Sweet Escape and Rich Girl. It is a alright song, but not anything that really drive into a bigger sound for Gwen. Hopefully, there are better songs from her down the road that are worth the while. Something will put us with her misery into a more upbeat song.\n\nSong: C"

We have lost a lot of those artists from drugs, alcohol, and self-doubt on whether they can be who they are today, as they did back then. This past year, we lost Prince, Pete Burns of Dead Or Alive and David Bowie to just name a few. But of all of the acts that have passed away, there has been some that really have came back strong personally and professionally. Phil Collins has made the ambitious decision about coming out of retirement, and coming back musically, and personally, and the decision has been both brilliant and personal. He re-released his entire catalog and his work has definitely sounded better than ever. But back in 1985, he was someone that took on a lot of heat when he sampled Prince's 1999  with his massive hit, Sussudio. But the song today sounds just as strong and vibrant, as it did back then. The song still makes me want to just get up, sing and dance. It is one of those fee-good anthems that really is worth the soul. If you have just re-discovered Phil's music, or are just a hard core Phil Collins fan, than you should download the song.\n\nSong: A"

But after his first two records which were more dormid and dark reflecting on divorce, Face Value & Hello I Must Be Going, he needed to have something more poppy and upbeat in his career. Than his landmark 1985 album, No Jacket Required came along, and earned Phil a lot of great acclaim and rewards, including Album Of The Year a the 1986 Grammy Awards. Now, looking back at Phil's legacy, I have always loved his brilliance in song, but also the choices he has made in song have been very strong. Even when he took a notorious use of Prince's music for Sussudio. The lead single from No Jacket Required, which took on a sample of Prince's 1999, actually is one of those uplifting songs that have been strong from the soul, and definitely upbeat in the rhythm at heart. It is a great song worth listening too, and one of those tracks that really was a game changer for Phil in the 80's that is still fun to listen to. If you've never heard a Phil Collins song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: A-"

You've exhausted everything else.\n\nHere's how ""Phone Power"" compares to previous TMBG works:\n\n1986 They Might Be Giants: Four Stars\n1988 Lincoln: Four and a Half Stars\n1990 Flood: Five Stars\n1992 Apollo 18: Four Stars\n1994 John Henry: Two and a Half Stars\n1996 Factory Showroom: Three and a Half Stars\n1999 Long Tall Weekend: Three and a Half Stars\n2001 Mink Car: Four Stars\n2002 No!: Four Stars\n2004 The Spine: Three Stars\n2005 Here Comes The ABC's: Four Stars\n2007 The Else: Three and a Half Stars\n2008 Here Comes The 123's: Three Stars\n2009 Here Comes Science: Four Stars\n2011 Join Us: Three Stars\n2013 Nanobots: Four Stars\n2015 Glean: Three Stars\n2015 Why?: Three Stars\n2016 Phone Power: Three Stars"

"19460","5","4","B01CJFMAJW","52d38fe63e8025a89819d54004ebb057KETS","This is a score that I didn't think would ever come out as a CD release.  It appeared to be ""digital only"" but my patience paid off and Sparks & Shadows (which is a record label created by Bear McCreary) finally released it.  McCreary makes a great statement on the Sparks & Shadows website where he says, ""I value the soundtrack experience, because score records are what first led me down the path to becoming a composer"".  He goes on to say, ""I was a fan and a collector long before I became a professional musician. I have always looked for ways to deliver my original scores to fans so they can have the same experiences.""  Let me say a big Thank You to Bear McCreary for looking out for the fans and collectors!\n\nI rarely get to go see movies in the theatre and out of all the ones that I am eagerly waiting to be released on BluRay, this one is probably the one that I am on pins and needles to see the most.  The reviews are great, the trailer looks mysterious, and the soundtrack is awesome!  One of the great things about the CD release is that it comes with a massive 24 page insert with photos from the movie, photos of the scoring recordings, musician credits, production notes, and a very detailed account of the score creation written by Bear McCreary.  The insert contains a fascinating account of how the score was developed and fun insights into McCreary's creativity as a musician and composer.  Some amazing facts about the score is how much McCreary studies the characters and the fact that he visits the set to get a feel for the movie and it's story.  I know many composers do this, but to hear McCreary's account of going to the movie set to study some of the smallest details like the vents/air ducts in the bunker and feeling the claustrophobic atmosphere in some of the spaces is pretty intense.  McCreary's goal was to capture the musical sounds of the subterranean bunker and the people within.\n\nThe score opens with the beautiful piece entitled ""Michelle"" (track 1).  The cue begins with a single instrument, the Tanbur.  This exotic Middle Eastern instrument has been used by McCreary before in his ""Da Vinci's Demons"" TV scores.  What's interesting about this single instrument is that this cue and technique is inspired by McCreary's mentor, Elmer Bernstein.  Wow...didn't know that Bernstein was his mentor!  The liner notes state that Bernstein felt that the opening few seconds of a score were the most important because it was here that you would have the audience's full attention before they get lost within the visuals and story.  Bernstein felt that beginning a score with a single instrument that would represent the film, was a good practice and apparently one that McCreary has put into play within this soundtrack.  This opening track really does set up the entire score and I hear a sadness and mystery in it that sets a tone for the film.  McCreary plays with this theme throughout the score and I love the sound produced by this instrument.\n\nAnother interesting fact concerning this score is McCreary's use of a very unusual instrument known as the Blaster Beam.  I never even knew that this instrument even existed, yet I'm very familiar with the sound.  I actually thought it was just sound generated by an electronic keyboard.  It's basically a 12 to 18 foot long metal beam (sometimes made out of aluminum), that has wires under various degrees of tension that are struck with sticks, pipes, or fingers to create some very bizarre and amazing sounds.  Jerry Goldsmith used it for his ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" score as a way to identify V'ger.  I looked it up on YouTube and you can see some video demonstrations of the instrument.  McCreary contacted Craig Huxley, the same guy who played the instrument for the Star Trek film, and used him for this particular score.  A great piece in this score that highlights the Blaster Beam is ""Hazmat Suit"" (track 8).  You can hear this fascinating instrument throughout the score and McCreary uses it masterfully.\n\nMcCreary adds a lot of musical textures to this score including layered vocals by Raya Yarbrough on pieces like ""Howard"" (track 3) and various other unique instruments that create a gloomy, frightful, and mysterious atmosphere within this bunker and the people we are observing.  The score, sounds very classic to me, but with some unusual modern instrument enhancements.  Reviewer Paul Allaer mentioned that the score has a very Bernard Herrmann sound to it and I agree.  It has that Hitchcock movie vibe to it but also an ingenuity that gives it a sound of it's own.  The liner notes even mention McCreary and J.J. Abrams discussions concerning Herrmann and Goldsmith's styles.\n\nIt's simply a fascinating score to listen to and I really appreciate the great liner notes provided by Sparks & Shadows that bring a lot of insight into the making of the music.  Bear McCreary fans will not be disappointed with this release and the composer continues to shine with yet another amazing score.  The CD release contains 14 tracks with a running time of 64 minutes.  The CD insert is wonderful but the thing is so big that it barely fits into the insert slots on the front of the case!  It's a wonderful release and I highly recommend picking this one up!"
"19461","4","","B01CJFMAJW","a27141356dab578725386e76b9246caf0WAS","The weekend before last I saw ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" in the theater (more on that later). I was struck by the orchestral score and made a mental note to myself that I needed to check it out. When I started looking into it, my search led me to this. The orchestral score is composed by Bear McCreary, best known for his work on various high-profile TV series (The Walking Dead, Outlander, Black Sails, etc.). Here McCreary ups his game a level or two, in ways not seen before from him.\n\n""10 Cloverfield Lane - Music from the Motion Picture"" (14 tracks; 64 min.) opens with ""Michelle"" (as the movie opens, and Michelle decides to leave her boyfriend and get out of New Orleans). It is a 6 min. mini-suite of sorts, exploring various emotions along the way. What a great way to kick off the soundtrack. And when we get to the next track ""The Concrete Cell"", this is an 8+ min. epic track that enforces the dark mood and desperation that besets Michelle and Emmett. It is rare these days that we get treated to such long soundtrack pieces, and while after the initial two super-long tracks many of them are quite shorter, there still are several other long ones to come still. ""Two Stories"" is one of my favorites on here, with more of that threatening undercurrent that leaves you wondering, almost anxious. It is one of several tracks on here that made me think back of Bernard Hermann's work all those decades ago when he score many of Hitchcock's movies, and I do mean this as a high complement. ""Valencia"" is al all-out action piece. The last track on here is what plays over the movie's end titles. In all, I am very impressed with this score. PLEASE NOTE: this soundtrack contains only the orchestral score, and it leaves out the various songs that appear in the movie, including ""I Think We're Alone Now"", by Tommy James & The Shondellas, in a pivotal scene, but also ""Tell Him"" (by The Exciters) and ""Venus"" (by Frankie Avalon).\n\nAs to the movie itself, it is pretty darn good. Not an outright sequel to ""Cloverfield"", producer J.J. Abrams and newcomer-director  Dan Trachtenberg craft a mystery thriller that keeps you guessing for a very long time (in the best possible way) what the heck is going on. Was Michelle recued? or kidnapped? Come for the mystery, stay for the jaw-dropping last 30 minutes! ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", both the soundtrack and the movie, is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Some of the best performances were also in the ""Big Violin Box"". e.g., the Suk recordings of the Mozart Concertos ##2 & 3. the Oistrakh recording of the Dvorak and the Elman recordings of the Lalo Symphonie espagnole (4 movement version).  That also has some of the Szigeti/Arrau Beethoven Sonatas (##6, 7 & 8) and excellent recordings of the Franck Sonata and Beethoven's ""Kreutzer"" by Oistrakh, as well as a number of encores performed by Oistrakh and by Elman.  This does have a very fine recording of the Glazunov Concerto with Oistrakh , a good (if old-fashioned) Elman recording of a Bach Concerto and very fine (and comparatively modern) recordings of the Bruch Concerto #1 and his Scottish Fantasy.  On the other hand...\n\nThe Joseph Silverstein recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky and Mozart #5 are, to put it mildly, disappointing.  There's just nothing very distinctive here.  There is no ""personality and he often seems rather tentative.  The Tchaikovsky is played with the cuts restored but some of these are rather repetitive passages sound even more forced and repetitive than normal here.  The orchestral contributions (Utah Symphony under various un-named conductors, except for the Mozart, which has the Rochester Philharmonic) add little.  The sound (probably from the 1980s) has less presence than many RCA recordings from the 1950s.  If you don't have the Big Violin Box and/or have an interest in the Glazunov and Bruch, it's worth it but otherwise, consider carefully.  If these would be your only recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky, you're cheating yourself."

From the 2016 album blackSummersnight, this is the Grammy Award-winning song by the double Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer, and actor Maxwell. He has planned his musical career over long periods of time, followed by his eagerly-awaited albums becoming hits and spawning hit singles. Considering the significant gaps of time between them, up to 7 years, including 2 albums from the trilogy with variations of the words blacksummersnight, his artistry has shown bright throughout his career. This album was preceded by the 2009, Grammy-winning album, Blacksummersnight.\n\nOn Lake by The Ocean, written by Musze (Maxwell) and Hod David, which won the Grammy for Best R&B Song, Maxwell establishes a definite catchy groove that persists throughout the song and drives the simple, repetitive, but brilliant lyrics. Over a deliberate beat from the urgent drums, Maxwell uses his natural range voice to tell the story, switching to his falsetto voice range to raise the intensity with repetition of the refrain on this song. This song lingers in the mind long after the music has stopped. The musical support group includes the likes of Hod David on bass and other instruments, Robert Glasper on keyboards, Darryl Lil Man Howell or Mark Colenburg on drums, Derrick Hodge on bass, and others. My Highest Recommendation. Five INSISTENT Stars. (Columbia Records. 1-MP3 track. X-Ray lyrics. Time-3:58.)"

I'd never encountered Dohnanyi's chamber music before, nor had I heard the Arensky 2nd Quartet or the Clarinet Quintet of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.

There were 4 more bonus tracks available on the DVD, which were downloadable, for a total of 29 songs. Phil thought that was too many songs, so for this 2016 remaster, he retitled the album ""The Essential Going Back"" and trimmed it down to 14 songs. This is a blunder in my view, no matter how he justifies it. Especially with 2 CDs to fill up. The other 15 songs could have (and should have) been somewhere on this collection, even if they were weaker than the 14 songs he chose to keep (which will be a matter of opinion to each listener). It's sort of like ""Coda"" by Led Zeppelin. The last album, and weakest one, but one you still need to complete your collection. The songs here aren't terrible, the production is great and if I could describe the performances in one word, it would be ""perfunctory."""

This isn't a bad album  (Well, except for Keep the Family Close and Pop Style) just one that's so......predictable. Views feels like it's going for the atmosphere and vibe of the much better and more original Take Care, but comes across as an imitation with the energy sapped right out of it. On the comparatively  few instances where Drake raps, he sounds almost disinterested, and his rhymes are some of his least inspired yet. Moments where the rap elements of Views truly come alive (like the great Weston Road Flows) are incredibly few and far in between.\n\nThe singing on the other hand feels like the same old thing. There's the same 80s-sounding pop track, there's the duet with Rihanna, there's the weird sort of dance track featuring Partynextdoor, there's the slow jam near the end of the album......it all seems to be mining familiar territory. And though Fire and Desire's one of Drake's best slow jams and of course it's impossible to deny the catchiness of Controlla and One Dance or the slick production throughout, many of the singing tracks similarly feel sunk by a disinterested-sounding MC and the feeling that we've been here before but better.\n\nDrake's longtime producer 40 (who comes back to the forefront after taking slightly smaller roles on Nothing Was the Same and If You're Reading This It's Too Late) does what he does best, providing a truly ambient and dreamy backdrop that has become Drake's sound. I wish the hip hop-focused If You're Reading This sounded at least close to this good, and while his work keeps Views going, it never really takes off because Drake just never really seems to be trying to do anything other than what's expected of him.\n\nStill, if you're a fan of Drake you should find at least a decent amount to like here; it does have its moments and an oftentimes top notch production. I thought it was solid for a couple of listens, but there hasn't been much for me to come back to. Many aspects seem to be firing on all cylinders, but Drake's uninspired performance and a general lack of anything new makes Views his most forgettable LP yet."

I have to admit, at first I wasn't really ""getting it"", but over time, this album has in turn released its inner beauty and I have been playing this album a LOT in the last couple of months, ahead of the band's return to Cincinnati (more on that later).\n\n""A Moon Shaped Pool"" (11 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the urgent ""Burn The Witch"", which reminds me of the ""Hail to the Thief"" songs. It is followed by ""Daydreaming"", an introspective tune (and traditional concert opener on the current tour). We then get to ""Decks Dark"", which is my favorite track: I love the gradual build-up, and then the extra kick in the last 90 sec., just perfect, The album is now revved up and in full gear. Not that it means the songs are all loud or hard, far from it, but there is a cohesion to the soundscape as we go from track to track that just feels right. Among other highlights: ""Ful stop"" is mesmerizing, and ""The Numbers"" feels wistful. The album's closer is ""True Love Waits"", the song that has been around for 2 decades in one form or another. The live acoustic guitar version on 2001's ""I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings"" is a thing of beauty, but now comes this definitive version, featuring piano and keyboards, rather than acoustic guitar. What a great song.\n\nI've seen Radiohead live a number of times over the years, and had the good fortune of seeing them in concert again this week here in Cincinnati. They played a 2 hr. 20 min. show that can only be described as magical. Playing from pretty much their entire catalog, the sold-out crowd ate it up from start to finish. The 4 songs from ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" blended in nicely. Check this out: Set List Cincinnati 7/25/18: 1. Daydreaming 2. Desert Island Disk 3. Ful Stop 4.2 + 2 = 5 5. Myxomatosis 6. Kid A 7.

It contains chamber music works from various composers of the classical and early romantic periods of classical music, including (among others): Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Giacchino Rossini, and Luigi Boccherini.\n\nI am much more familiar with most of these composers chamber works than I am with those featured on Big Chamber Music Box Volumes 1 and 2  (both of which I have reviewed here at Amazon.com).  My expectations for the music on this third volume were therefore very high, and I am pleased to report that the music in no way disappointed. Indeed, I am very favorably impressed with both the selections that appear on this album, and the quality of the performances. My favorites include Haydns Quartet for Guitar and Strings in D major; Beethovens Duo for Clarinet and Bassoon in C major; and, of course, Mozarts incomparable Serenade for Winds in B flat major Gran Partita.  I also find Boccherinis Quintet for Guitar and Strings in E major to be especially enjoyable.\n\nAs is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is excellent. This is a clear winner that I think is hands-down the best of the three Big Chamber Music Box volumes from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, its also an unbeatable bargain that deserves a place in every classical music collectors digital library. Most highly recommended."

For Ariana Grande, she has been trying to mature into diva-hood like the ranks of divas from Mariah Carey to the great Whitney Houston (as her lackluster drive had shown on the ABC show Greatest Hits.) For Ariana, I was not very impressed with her lackluster songs already released from her Dangerous Woman album from Into You and Dangerous Woman. But also her song from last year, Focus didn't even shine her voice brighter, instead her voice sounded more shrill and putting too much emphasis on looking for herself, than a real voice. Her latest single, Let Me Love You, the third from her Dangerous Woman, isn't actually a striking duet. She and Lil' Wayne do not even have enough chemistry to sparkle on this track to shimmer as one of the more classic duets. Perhaps ariana has more growing up she has to do to make the heart firmly fonder. Maybe when she makes another record, it will work for her, but not now.\n\nSong: D+"

"19876","5","","B01FV9GS3M","61e9b160f618f24607d57cdf56ddd34a3VGY","When Revocation first emerged on the metal scene, we knew something different was afoot, and that was the playing of leader/guitarist extraordinaire Dave Davidson, a musician of the calibre of the ultra greats.  Instead of relying on the usual bag of tricks most metal and death metal players use, Davidson threw in more curveballs than you could believe, with quirky choices of notes, delightful off kilter chord patterns and an innovative approach that got the attention of lots of people outside the metal realm.  Imagine Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew and other denizens of very precise yet unhinged playing.\n  The new album ""Great Is Our Sin"" is, like the others, Revocation at their best, but there are some differences here that are worth pointing out.  First, the production seems to be a bit tighter, the guitar interplay a little more refined, making the riffs and hooks stand out a little better.  It still belts out the power but has become less cluttered.  The other is a few sections of clean and harmonizing vocals, a trend many death bands are starting to rediscover, and in this case, the clean vocals are such a welcome addition.  It makes those parts stand out like sore thumbs, especially the harmony parts.  I hope Revocation ditches the screaming all the way around because it will bring more attention to arrangements and hooks.  The whole schtick of grunting is getting old and my prediction is that there will be a fairly sizable reversion back to singing vocals.  It won't be complete, but it will happen.  ""Great Is Our Sin"" is a great metal album, fans of King Crimson and other experimental sounds will be interested, and if their cards are played right, this is the album that could propel Revocation into the big time without sacrificing their signature wackiness and heaviness doing it."

Unfortunately, most of the covers in the past several years have been jokes and not really as classy as the original songs have been. The past several years for R&B have been more of the overexposure of acts like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. But for classic songs, they haven't really been shown the compassion and care that had been drove like songs did years ago. For Will Downing, he has been one of those R&B singers, known more for his concerts than even having a glance on the radio. But when he has sung a song, it is worth listening to. His cover of Cherelle & Alexander O' Neal's song Everything I Miss At Home definitely is a bright light, in a industry that has been more about flaunting the outers than the inner voice itself. It is a nice cover, and definitely ranks into the few that have been worth listening to the past few years like Musiq Soulchild's version of Maze's Silky Soul in 2010. It is a good song, and a treat for classic vintage R&B that is just missed in this industry today.\n\nSong: B"

I was watching a video on Instagram and the song was playing in the background. Immediately came over to Amazon so I could 1) hear the entire song and 2) purchase it for myself.\n\nWhat a message this song gives, and Rihanna's delivery is amazing. Reminds us that we have more power than we sometimes give ourselves credit for. That ""wall"" that we face that we think might be the end of us could be what is between us and the breakthrough we are looking for. The hurt we think we might experience is the chance we have to take to move forward.\n\nWow. What a song and what a delivery. SLEDGEHAMMER speaks to me on so many levels."

Avid Ghostbusters nuts like myself might notice a slight difference in the way Ray Parker Jr sings. But it's still pretty darn close. There are also versions by Pentatonix and Walk On The Moon (my favorite other than the original) and of Course the new Ghostbusters Theme by Fall Out Boy and Missy Elliot. I also really love some of the other tracks on here, including Girls Talk Boys, Party Up In Here, Get Ghost, and one of my personal favorite tracks on this new sound track, Good Girls.

How when in danger they have heroes to turn to.  The original inspired and entertained.  The music energized fans everywhere, and the Ray Parker Jr.'s voice was powerful.\n\nThis music sucked, and the verses were distort versions of the original.
