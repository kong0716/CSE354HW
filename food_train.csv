I like it better than generic brands that I have used as some didn't dissolve all the way and I would end up with a ton of soap residue. Finish doesn't leave a ton of residue, but as far as taking off grime, I don't see much being done. It left a thin layer of milk of a cup and I am always rewashing after the heavy wash cycle. I would probably try an upgraded version but when we already rinse our dishes before we put them in the dishwasher, I would like for the dishes to get cleaned and for me not to still have to hand wash. It's kind of pointless. It's not horrible, but I'm not impressed :("

Flavor was acceptable by my children and went down rather easy after they figured out how to take medicine like this (tilt head back, open mouth, mom pours pellets into mouth, swallow with some water).\n\nIt does have the same active ingredient as the adult Mucinex which does work for me and my husband. As far as actual efficacy goes, I noticed very little difference in their congestion levels before and after taking this medicine and I am not certain that they experience any relief from their mucous congestion. It may be that my children are young... just barely old enough to take this as it is recommended for 4 years. And up so they do not yet know how to physically cough up and expel mucous. Thus, I'm not sure I would buy again in the near future. Maybe I would try it again when my kids are older.\n\nSo, while I cannot give this an enthusiastic recommendation, I think just like with all other over-the-counter remedies, you can try it and if it doesn't work for you...then you can try something else."

My 5 year old was so disappointed so I thought I made a felt tree and felt ornaments to put up on the wall. When it came to actually put it on the wall is when I ran into a problem.  There wasn't a safe and effective way of hanging it up. Tape didn't hold it up, tacks would but if my babies pulled on it, it would pose a safety hazard. So I decided to give this a try. It allowed me to hang the tree on the wall with no problem. It stayed up for weeks of my 5 year old decorating and redecorating the tree. My babies would pull it off the wall from time to time but it took them a long enough time that I would notice and go over before they could put the putty in their mouths.\n\nI also use this year round for everything. Hanging up kid artwork, putting lining in my cabinets and drawers in my rental, adding memos to our visual calendar, etc. It is a pretty handy thing we always have on hand and would probably benefit most household!"

By itself, the taste is pretty chalky and gross.\nYou can also mix it in a drink or food, but I find it's faster acting to pour it into your tongue & drink something immediately to swallow it down.\nMy headaches go away or greatly reduce within 15-30 minutes after consumption."

Apply in shower or after using toilet.  I use 1 wrapper per tbsp of skin creme, hair conditioner creme, and make in large batches then put in jars.

It's got a nice non-medicinal taste, goes down easily, and works quickly to silence that pesky hacking cough. As a mucolytic agent (breaks up that thick mucous in your throat), this syrup works exceptionally well and fast. You can finally get a good night's sleep!\n\nPROS:\n\n-nice taste\n\n-easy to swallow\n\n-works quickly\n\n-*for most family members greater than 2 years old\n\n-terrific mucolytic agent gets the 'gunk' out.\n\n-safe, natural ingredients\n\n-allows you to sleep well.\n\nCONS:\n\n-higher cost than others\n\n-must take it every 2 hours (but still works if you want to sleep)\n\nSum: Worth the cost"

He hasn't complained but neither has he said he feels better.  Just watching his symptoms of cough and congestion, I can easily see that it is not as effective as his night time medicines.\n\nIf you have complex health problems though, you should check with your doctors office.  Homeopathic does not mean there cant be interactions with medicines.  The benefit to this homeopathic mixture: I checked with the nurse at his cardiologists office and she didn't see any problems with the ingredients.  I don't have to worry about side effects with the complex medications he takes for his heart."

So I always get the 2-in-1 to use in addition to conditioner, because it helps detangle my hair more.\n\nThe best thing about this product was that it works really well. When you first use it, it creates this cooling sensation on your skin, because of the peppermint. (It also kind of clears my sinuses? Added bonus, I guess.) It smells nice, too. My first week using it, I noticed that my scalp no longer itched as much, especially towards the end of the day, when my past shampoos usually wear off. Now that I've used it regularly for a while, I'm sad to say that I don't notice the cooling effect as much, but that could be because 1) I got too used to it, or 2) I've come to the end of the bottle and it's not mixed as evenly.\n\nAll in all, I love this product and will keep on using it in the future."

I have always loved it and did not intend to change, but shopping in prime pantry section I noticed a discount on this one and since it was also 2 in1 and head and shoulders, decided to give it a try.\n\nI have came across couple of fake head and shoulders shampoos in my life and it was easy to tell from smell and texture and then after washing the hair with it, the result is pretty obvious. Since this one was of another ""flavour"" then the one I usually use, I couldn't tell if that is the reason for it to have different texture and smell (it smells somewhat like a candy or a chewing gum, not ok for a shampoo!) or the low quality, but after having washed my hair with it, I can definitely tell it is nothing to be compared with the original one. My hair is slightly damaged, and it needs proper care for it not to get worse and I try to give that care as much as I can. Yes this shampoo is cheap, but I would rather pay couple of dollars more and get the proper shampoo for my hair.\n\nOverall I do not like it and do not recommend it to anyone.

(I wish I bought stock in 3M years ago when they began marketing OTC products of such high-quality). Carefully applied to clean dry skin in the desired position it sticks ONLY ONCE, but then stays on comfortably for days and one can monitor the condition of the wound below without removal & with rare skin irritation. Research proves that bandaged wounds heal significantly better & faster with less scarring or risk of infection. A wet wound, like inside your cheek looks different, and so does what you see under this dressing because it allows healing fluids to accumulate. Be not alarmed at the paler look of the moist wound. it is merely what normally happens under a scab.\nIf the wound drainage works its way to the edge of the bandage or the bandage gets smelly, it's time to change. The icky smell is just dead cells removed from the wounded area. If covered by a scab, the body disposes of the waste internally. It seems healthier to me for dead cells to leave your body directly from the wound than to be absorbed inside and filtered out through the body's already busy organs. The soft wound Tegaderm allows new skin cells produced below the skin surface to move outward and create new skin more easily. Knowing the process,, one can see why healing through a scab takes longer.\nFYI: Tegaderm is also great for\n1). Keeping other items in place on skin- from medicated patches to pulse meters  . (DEFINITELY ask your healthcare provider before using this product over medicated patches as effectiveness may change when certain medicated patches covered!). The savings of otherwise lost medicated patches negates the cost of using Tegaderm keeping them  in place.\n2). I also keep a supply of many other 3M Nexcare bandages do use instead of ""plasters"" like Band-Aids. Nexcare's small bandages have Tegaderm holding a piece of gauze on the wound. Though you cannot see thru the gauze on 3M's ""plasters,"" you still receive their benefitcial properties of excellent adherence PLUS flexible waterproof wound protection! Bonus!"

I couldn't wait to prepare her a meal using the Jar Goods Classic Spicy Tomato Sauce.  The jar says 16 ounces.  I wanted to divide the jars contents into two 8 ounce servings.  Tammy is very particular about spicy food.  I wanted to fry some turkey meat, add it to the spicy tomato sauce, and then pour this mixture over some simple Tri-Color Rotini noodles.  If it wasn't too spicy, I would mix the rest of the sauce with some peeled steamed shrimp and put it over some linguine.\n\n  However, when I was dividing the sauce, I learned that my jar didn't contain 16 ounces of sauce.  It was more like 12 ounces.  It was definitely not 14.  The jar will contain 16 ounces of water when completely filled to the top.  Amazons website for Jar Goods depicts all the jars filled completely to the top with sauce.  Mine was not.  In fact, if you look at the ingredients, the jar reads that one serving equals 1/2 cup of sauce.  There are approximately 3.5 servings in a jar.  That means there are approximately 1.75 cups of sauce in a jar.  This translates into approximately 14 ounces of sauce.  2 cups would equal 16 ounces.\n\n  Like I stated earlier, I think there was more like 12 ounces in my jar.  (I could have kicked myself for not taking a photograph of the jar before I opened it; I could swear the sauce was not filled to the top.  This would be one of those times when several jars would have made for a better review.)  However, the sauce tasted delicious; it was not too spicy.  I gave some of my leftovers to Tammy and she liked them.  I was hoping to have enough sauce to add with some steamed shrimp and linguine but there wasn't enough.  Tammy loves shrimp.  Shes not a big fan of ground turkey meat.\n\n  Overall, I think Jars Goods Classic Spicy Tomato Sauce is very expensive tomato sauce.  It is not as thick as I would have imagined it to be.  The expiration date is 3/16/19, which is a very good date.  It must have a lot of preservatives in it.  The jar is very pretty and decorative.  It would make a nice present for someone, like me, who enjoys cooking with tomato sauce.  As for me, I will probably be doing more cooking with less expensive brands of tomato sauce.  Because there are at least six people living in my condo at any given time, I must remain frugal about the money I spend on food."

I use this often for a casserole for two, or chicken salad for two. If you like this product's regular flavor, then you're likely to enjoy switching up with this on occasion. I plan to make chicken burritos this week using Ortega taco mix to season the chicken. I would prefer quesadillas, but I only have liquid cheese food in the kitchen. (Frito Lay in the can. Bought what I could from Amazon on a painful budget. AMFresh still doesn't deliver in my area, so I live off pantry since I am housebound now and unable to get out to a grocery store.) Will edit review when I see how it goes. Also plan to make chicken pasta salad for lunch using Suddenly Salad by Betty Crocker (fiesta flavor?). Will let you know if the smoke flavoring gets in the way. I say flavoring because I highly doubt this ""meat"" has actually been smoked. Just my uninformed opinion. Of course, I miss my Dad's smoked chicken, but the old days are gone. Hopefully, I can make recipes that will force my brain to think it's the real thing.\n\nBut let's be honest, the texture of Swanson's can chicken is suspect at best. It's one of those items you just scarf down underneath a ton of spices and hope your body doesn't hate you later. That said, it makes a great chicken curry over rice if you're not obsessed with food texture. It breaks up easily. But when it doesn't, you get a mouthful of ""chicken"" that doesn't have the right mouth feel along with a very processed flavor. Beggars can't be choosers. It's the best canned chix on the market that I've tried.\n\nI'd rather eat saitan, but Amz doesn't carry it in pantry yet. THAT should say something about my feelings regarding this chicken's texture. And still, I've had worse. Much worse.\n\nFor now, go Swanson's or go home."

When I purchased this, it was $3.91 for the bucket of 3, I thought that is a great deal so I got one, and enticed I also picked up the Cheddar Cheese, which has it's own review elsewhere in the Amazon products review.  Suffice it to say this was more smoky than ""bacon"", which was okay and less maple than brown sugar, also okay.  The mixing process a little messy, but I'm grateful for the bucket which helps to shake it better than you'd be able to in an open bowl.  The popcorn pkg is enough to fill the bucket, the ""buttery"" liquid followed by the powdered flavoring make for quick work even tho a little messy but it's part of the fun, right which of course you'll want to wash your hands before you ge them greasy again, but you're going to handle the remote unless you have voice control?  Lol, this flavor is really good and I'd buy it again. but NOT for the prices they cite as of this writing which is over $10 for to other flavors in which I've no interested.  I'd pay $5 but after that I can make my own, hey I've got the buckets and I'm making Hawaiian-style Hurricane Popcorn which is much tastier anyway."

"1476","4","","B015MJUHBU","d75dae90a8c3316a835c35f64c21fe16S9M0","The truth is that I didn't want this flavor, I wanted butter flavor.  But, after reading the description, I realized that it IS butter popcorn with the maple bacon flavor packed separately.  So, I ordered multiple units at the heavily discounted price at the time.  I cannot comment on the maple flavoring, but eating it as butter popcorn - it is great.  It is a very nice butter flavor in a packet that lets you control the application.  The popcorn itself pops completely and is unusually tender and ""low kernel"".  It does not stick in the teeth nearly as bad as other brands; it is even better than some of the ""hull free"" brands.  The only reason that I took off a star, is that the regular, replacement, price is WAY too high for three very small bags of popcorn.  It is consistent in price, or cheaper, than the Pine Valley website, so it is not Amazon's fault.  It is just that $5 to or more per tiny pack of popcorn is insane!  Sadly, I won't reorder unless the price goes way back down again."

The flavor was fine. However, I was disappointed in the noodle content.  The content of my container seemed to a great deal of broth and an unusually small volume of noodles.  Based on this, I much prefer the can of Campbell's condensed chicken noodle soup in comparison.  It's just that I like a little more substance with my soup, and the volume of the flat little noodles in the microwavable Homestyle soup didn't provide that for me.  That being said, I will state that I have tried three store brands of chicken noodle soup previously, and have concluded that for me, the flavor of Campbell's broth is superior, or at least is the one that my son and I both prefer. We'll just continue to buy the condensed version and forego the convenience of the microwavable container for this one type of soup.\n11/30/17 update: I've subsequently eaten several additional containers of the Campbell's Homestyle soup in the microwavable container and the noodle content in them was fine.  My original rating for them was 3 stars, but after consuming soup from the additional containers, I upped my rating for this soup to 4 stars."

My son really likes this soup so I gave all of them to him to stash in his new apartment. The soup is delicious. Yes it has a lot of salt, as does almost all canned soups, but it's good to have a few cans of soup for cold days when a fast meal is needed.  The soup has a see-through, pull-off lid under the rigid circular frame at the top of the container. The ""see-through"" lid is adhered securely to the top of the ""can"". This soup came with our 1st Pantry order. The box had a divider which created 3 internal sections for protection of crushable items. Everything arrived in perfect condition within 2 days. The whole family was amazed and we are already in the process of our 2nd order."

For reference, I prefer Dunkin Donuts French Vanilla as far as taste.  That being said,  this is a good tasting coffee and on par as a replacement.  I am not a connoisseur of coffee but i greatly enjoy a few cups on a daily basis and know what i like.  I like mid range coffee, strong but not ""mud"" like or pitch black. Krispy Kreme is smooth and not bitter but the reason i choose to buy it in bulk is for its value.  Its the best tasting coffee at the best price I have found. Compare the price per cup to other Keurig brands and you will be impressed.  Taste a cup and you will be surprised.\n\nIn addition to the value, I like that these come packaged in 12 instead of 10 cups. For me this is a more natural package size and more convienent"

You don't.\n\nI really can't distinguish the flavor on this from just chicken seasoning. That being said, I'd call it a high end chicken seasoning, but still just chicken seasoning. I think it would be fantastic actually blended with genuine ale in basting poultry or pork if you make your own marinades. I also think it would be absolutely wonderful in chicken soup or on a rotisserie chicken.\n\nEven though it tastes pretty good, it just doesn't really seem like it warrants the Belgian Ale portion of the title.

As a Southerner, I enjoy Cajun food, and I naturally assumed that a company like McCormick would have a hard time actually capturing a spicy flavor that I would consider good enough for our table. While I know that some of my local foodie friends would declare this not to be ""Cajun"" at all, I would describe it as a very flavorful blend with a relatively mild kick. There is definitely some red pepper and paprika present, along with a little garlic flavor that overall makes this a surprising delicious (and versatile) spice blend.\n\nThus far, I have tried this on pizza, vegetables, shrimp, and chicken, and I would say that it works quite well as an everyday seasoning for the table. I have not yet cooked with it, and I am not sure I would actually. This seems like the kind of blend that you use to accent a dish just before eating.

He has a sensitive tummy, and this works as well (or better!) than some of the exorbitantly expensive ""specialty"" wet cat foods targeting that particular issue.  He BEGS for it -- he's never done that with any other food.\n\nThe packaging takes a bit of getting used to -- took me awhile to figure how to peel off the foil top without getting the juice all over the counter and myself (my trick is to peel it ""backwards"" -- toward me, with the opening pointing the opposite direction and go slow).  The ""perfect portion"" aspect works for my guy, too -- he gets one portion in the morning, the other in the late afternoon.\n\nOverall, solid 5 stars from me and Fred (Fettucine Alfredo)"

I don't buy Combos on a regular basis, nor do I buy kids lunch size snacks, so my price radar may be off but at almost $4 for this box of 12 tiny packages it seems pricey.

The convenience and low prices with good taste have been fine or so I thought over the years but my autoimmune and allergies issues have made me more careful out of necessity to limit flares and even migraine triggers the last few years. These highly preserved chemically rich and manipulated instant options are terrible for my health and my family seems to have far less digestion issues since we started making our own baked treats and knowing exactly what we put in our body's for energy is essential to our family health and happiness. If you Read and google ingredients in products like this and decide how much your family and your healths worth with these cheap options like I have ive found it's risking alot to just to decorate a birthday cake. Not everyone can afford organic but go simple and natural. Winco bulk items are cheaper than even these instant classics and you don't need to add 20 chemical softeners, preservatives and plastics to make a nice frosting. Ask your relatives or make it a fun family activity to spend time together mastering the right treats and you'll be better able to live with the right options for your health and your family's."

Also, don't put all cookies on top of each other or in any container. Let it cool off first (maybe 30 minutes or so).

With a good haircut, he doesn't have to give it much thought or fuss with it at all. After the cut, its all about the product. His day to day style is achieved by hand. Most of his hair gets pushed forward with the slightly longer front, center section pulled back and up. On the occasions he wears suits, etc, he spends an extra minute to achieve a cleaner look (less spiky in front, more wave). Of the five old spice hair products he tried, he ranked the Molding Putty highest for providing the most control. Swagger Gel was his second favorite, also for its ability to hold.

There is no need for professionalism here - I bought stuff with my hard earned loot that I made whist being a professional and - well, I just want to talk/write how I normally do among peeps that I know.  Anyways....\n\nWhy aren't there more than just two damn thong panty liner makers out there?  Any store you go to, there is the damn great wall of pads - but only two teeny boxes of thong-tha-thong-tha-thong (can never pass up a good Sisqo reference).  One of each 'major' brand: [1] Carefree aka the pink box ones (whoah, they totally missed out on branding themselves as 'Pink Box' - good job, Carefree!) and then [2] Kotex aka black box ones (girl, I am NOT going there at all).\n\nMind you the black box is super snazzy, I dig the design and tend to buy with my eyes because I am a typically female that can see....but I need to remind myself that I will not be wearing the box as a panty liner since said box is in no way absorbent and it will absolutely not alleviate my terrible cramps and nausea by looking at it.\n\nThese liners are NOT the winner.  For the first time in YEARS I actually bled through to my choonies.  While that makes me feel all young again, it's def not cool.  This marks maybe the 3rd time that has happened in my 20+ year period career.  Are they barely there as the name suggests?  Yes.

This is my new favorite conditioner for three big reasons:  this rinses out quickly and easily, and does not leave an oily residue on the sink or tub, or me.  And secondly, this has that great eucalyptus scent that I can't get enough of.  It's subtle but refreshing.  Third, it makes my hair full, soft and gorgeous.  I have find soft hair which tends to be dry.  Any type of oily or heavy conditioner weights it down, aside from being hard to rinse out.  This is light and there is no hint of any oils or grease from it.  My hair is fluffy and clean looking and feeling after using this, which has been a difficult thing for a conditioner to do for my hair.\n\nAnd the best part is that there are zero tangles in my hair.  I color my hair at home, and this can cause the hair to become rough and tangle easily when it's wet.  This seems to remove all tangles automatically. My brush glides through my hair after using this. It's perfect."

It may be that we accidentally stumbled upon something that works for him, used occasionally: H&S conditioner without shampoo.\n\nI have an acquaintance whose career is in glassblowing.\nThe heat from the kiln has wrought havoc with her hair, which is now as dry as straw.\nShe told me that she no longer even uses shampoo, but conditioner exclusively.\n\nOf course you would be buying conditioner to use with your shampoo, so my husband's experience with it may not seem applicable.\nBut I do think it speaks well for this particular H&S conditioner that it works well even without shampoo for controlling dry scalp and dandruff."

These are by far the best I have ever used. Now I will only buy this brand and this kind. I'll tell you why below, but it is not for the squeamish.\n\nWhenever I wore other pads, I often felt like I was wearing a diaper. They were so thick that I was constantly aware of them.\n\nI would also have issues with them not absorbing the blood  it would mostly sit on top of the pad. And I don't mean just those clumps that you sometimes get when you have your period. I think it was the plasticky material on top of other pads which kept the blood from actually soaking in. That is not a problem with this brand and style. These pads feel much more like cotton against your skin.\n\nI have actually been wearing these pads while bleeding heavily, and gone to the bathroom to find only a small soiled area on the top of the pad. Confused, I pulled the pad away from my underwear to find that, when looking at the bottom of the pad, it was completely soiled. The blood actually was sucked to the bottom of the pad! It didn't just sit there on top!\n\n The only negative to this product is the same negative that comes with all pads and tampons-all of the plastic trash involved; however, I do find that, because these are so absorbent, I typically use fewer of these per period than I did with any other brand. I will most likely continue using this brand until I muster the courage to try a menstrual cup."

This falls in the better group of heat-and-serve meals. It's spicy and flavorful, much more so than most brands of Pav Bhaji which can be bland. There is adequate sauce to serve over basmati rice, and the flavor holds up to brown basmati. This meal is supposed to be a chunky gravy, and it is.

It is like I have less frizz and flyaway hair. The scent of this conditioner also lingers on your pillowcase. You may find yourself sniffing your hair during the day or twirling your hair because it feels so soft and silky. This is really a very sensuous conditioner and the scent is intoxicating. This is just dreamy...\n\n~The Rebecca Review"

I order this along with the conditioner on a pantry order and figured I would try it out. Works well. I use color on my hair and it hasn't stripped it. It leaves my hair soft and fairly shiny. The conditioner is a must with this shampoo for me personally. Overall its a good shampoo for the price point. Scent is clean and warm. Its not too strong."

This reminds me of a shampoo I used as a teenager. I use this along with the conditioner to produce stronger shiny silky hair. Your hair will go from unmanageable to moisturized and soft. The scent of the shampoo and conditioner linger on your pillowcase. I also color my hair and this shampoo works great. It doesn't seem to strip the color. I'm happy.\n\n~The Rebecca Review"

I find that Claritin takes a few hours for some relief to be felt, and actually a few days to become fully effective. I believe that it may have to have some built up residue in the body to become fully effective. In any case, you may wish to purchase it locally as a generic brand from your local Super Center or pharmacy for far cheaper."

"4248","2","2","B01BOPVOPO","273382fc505e2e92361e7b2758bcc2672VOE","Not nearly absorbent enough for me for overnight. Okay for short term during the day, and maybe overnight with a really absorbent booster pad and a good bed pad in case the booster pad and pull up are not enough. Even with two good booster pads these pull ups are not adequate for overnight if I am very tired. Two good pees without waking up and I will probably have leaked out to the bed pad at least a little bit and by the third time I pee in my sleep the bed pad will be full. If I am really tired I will probably pee at least four times before I wake up. Some overnight pull ups will handle four good pees with a booster pad. These will handle maybe two pees in six hours if I am lucky and using a very good booster pad. If I am well rested, I might wake up after six hours and change my incontinence products. But if I am very tired, I might sleep fifteen hours without waking up at all, and these are useless for anything much over six hours in my experience, at least for a large active person with total urinary incontinence. If you are much smaller or are not active and do not eat and drink very much and therefore do not pee very much, then maybe these will work for you for overnight. Or if you never sleep more than six hours. Or if you are not totally incontinent, but just leak some of your pee and can hold the rest until you was up and get to the bathroom. These are very comfortable until they get full, which is why I gave them two stars instead of one. Also, there are far less absorbent products available, and other products that are too uncomfortable to use at all, so these deserve a better rating than those products. But these products do not come close to living up to the claims made for them, nor do they come close to other products that cost about the same and work much better. And there are other products that cost much less and work as well. So I cannot give them a better rating than a two stars rating. Buy them if you get a very good deal, or are not totally incontinent, or if you get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night to change your protection and want good looks and comfort even if it costs more. There is obviously a market for the product, and if the advertising for the product did not exaggerate so much, I might have given this product three stars, or I might not have bought the product at all, since I would have known that it would only rarely work for me overnight."

These are a nice alternative. If you have a healthy appetite, you'll enjoy these if you like ""rice crackers"" - they do have a very different flavor then crackers made out of wheat flour. If you really want to eat a low cal snack that tastes really good, I recommend the Quaker Rice Crisps. We bought them in the popcorn and kettle corn flavors and they were way more yummy than these and easy to digest as well if you are looking for a ""light"" cracker if you are not feeling well, or for a low cal/satisfying snack."

The ""Attacks even 7 day old stains?""  not sure what it means but I tested that theory out on a white cotton t-shirt I used to wipe up some oil i spilled which changing the oil on my jeep.  OK i didn't expect this to really get the oil out, just wanted to see how much it could get it out.  The shirt washed just fine but as expected the dark oily splotches faded a little but were mostly still there.  Ok so I can be amused by ridiculous advertising sometimes and the nature of 7 day old stains was just bothering me.  So, I waited 3 more days (because I didn't have the patience to wait a full six) and I washed the shirt again and to my surprise, there was no change.  The stains were still there and it hadn't even ben 7 days later.  As a contrasting experiment I used Gain and washed the short again with a bunch of socks and you know what, the darn Gain made a huge difference on the stains beyond the 7 day mark.  Its doubtful in most cases you will use a shirt to wipe up an oil spill but you will spill oily things on your shirt and don't be fooled by this ridiculous notion this Tide is any different than any other laundry detergent is claims to be better than.  The 7 day old stain is a worthless bit of marketing and unfounded.  Buy Gain if you want something that I have proven to myself does in fact work better than Tide AND smells much better."

(Vanilla and strawberry are cloyingly sweet, dark chocolate too much, milk chocolate was passable but lacked malt...)  Unfortunately, local stores don't carry just the chocolate malt flavor - Amazon to the rescue!\n\nI use this in two ways.  For people who need to gain weight or increase calorie consumption, I add it to a milkshake to flavor the shake.  Too strong?  Use half a packet instead of a full one.  For people who want to increase protein consumption and still consume less overall, this mixed into whole milk as a meal replacement keeps them full for longer and encourages less snacking.  (Again, it's an awfully strong flavor, so I use more than the recommended 8 ounces of milk, more like 16 and keep adding milk & mixing until it's gone... Perhaps a 2 meal replacement by the time I'm done.)\n\nEdit to add that I am not a trained medical professional, this is my experience with the product.

I don;' know whether this is helping him or not.\n\nSince he was diagnosed, my husband has made virtually no changes in his diet whatsoever.  He tried at first, but there was nothing in it for him.  He craves sweets.  He has several treats at night while he is watching television.  He snacks during the day.  He used to test his blood sugar two or three times a day.  That tended to make him more thoughtful about what he was eating.  Fortunately or unfortunately, one of his new medications is doing all the work for him now.

Naturally, I want to do other things that also promote good health... things like making organic food choices when possible, and avoiding things known to have a negative impact when I can. Sure, we all give in to cravings and make less than perfect choices, few of us are 'perfect'.\n\nOddly, this company comes out with a product that would appear to have a lot of promise for people who are struggling to maintain a healthy life, and yet, for no good reason, it contains red dye number 40.\nI understand the decision to contain the questionable sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium, even though other sweetening options might be better, but there is no reason this product needs to contain red dye.\n\nWhat you are getting in this package is psyllium husk, maltodextrine, citric acid, flavors, sweeteners, and dye.\n\nI guess it looks better to come out with a brand new product, than to come out with a campaign reminding people that if they increase their fiber intake by using one of their existing products, Metamucil, blood sugar can be 'supported'.\n\nAs a consumer, I feel just a little bit manipulated.\n\nAs far as taste is concerned Kama if you've ever had any product that contains psyllium husk comma you will recognize that flavor. It isn't offensive, and is so bland that some people might not even notice it. The lemonade flavor isn't overly artificial, and quite nice when mixed with ice cold water. As with all similar products, you need to drink it quickly before it congeals.\n\nWill the product actually work to slow sugar absorption, and thus help keep sugar spiking at bay?\nYes, I believe it can be a contributing factor in maintaining an even blood sugar level.\nIf nothing else, at least you'll poop a lot."

They're more in the range of smaller-than-usual traditional storebought cookies than what you expect of ""thins""--Oreo Thins, Hannah Max Cookie Chips, etc. The texture is average storebought texture, not think or crisp. Interestingly, they are less crumbly than the regular Simply Made cookies, which have multiple times arrived looking like they were deliberately smashed to bits. Maybe the air in the bag? They also don't taste as good to me as the regular Simply Made chocolate chip cookies, so I think they may have a different recipe as well as size (or maybe they're tweaked the overall recipe due to the crumbliness?).\n\nBut anyway, small-medium cookies in a resealable bag, nothing particularly thin or crisp, if that's what you were after."

He shuns things that have a different texture or taste than he is used to. I made some of this linguine with shrimp and mushrooms sauteed in olive oil and, to my surprise, my husband liked it. He said it didn't taste weird or too different from regular pasta.\n\nThe pasta is light brown in color but otherwise it is the same as the regular stuff as far as size and cooking time. It is filled with whole grains and high in fiber. It is no higher in calories than regular pasta and I feel it is tastier.

I dumped it out onto a plate and picked up each pasta and returned it to the container. There was about two to three tablespoons of salt left on the plate. I can't eat that much salt. I'd blow up like a balloon. The only thing I noticed is the pasta boiled out of the container and had to be broken apart every minute and pasta water poured back in every minute. It tastes just like any other Mac n cheese. I'm not sure what the salt is for. Possibly to keep the boil over. But I'm to Leary of making it with all that salt in it."

Like this blueberry tiny toast cereal, it's only 22 carbs per serving. So, that's my rational and I'm sticking to it! lol\n\nThese cereal pieces are very tiny, and says so in the name, I don't know why I thought they would be bigger. If i had to describe the taste, to me it's a lighter, puffy captain crunch, less sweet in flavor and a very, very mild blueberry flavor.\n\nThe blueberry flavor I assume comes from the little blue specks that is in and on the tiny toast. You have to eat them rather fast if you prefer a crunchy cereal ortherwise it turns to mush quick, like within 5 mins fast. By the time you get to the bottom of your bowl the milk has turned bluish and its a sea of tiny blue specks that are a bit not really hard, but I guess if you ground up dried blueberries it would be that kinda texture.\n\nNow, would I buy this particular cereal again...no, I don't think so. I mean it wasn't bad, but then it wasn't really so good that would make me want to run out and buy some more when I run out."

You do get some blueberry flavor (in fact a bit more than the strawberry version, this actually tastes like a blueberry muffin), but the crystals fall of very easily in milk and soon you just have sugary flavored toast shaped squares. Not even the milk is flavored well by all of the blue crystals that fall off. If you can get these for a good price, I suggest eating only about 1/4 of a cup at a time to get the full flavor."

I remember when i was a kid having log cabin syrups, this taste is not the same as i remember, its a light syrup, but its taste is watered way down.  I like it, but its not what i expected from a syrup standpoint, profits should not detract quality, and this syrup is extended, i have made better syrups in less than half a day before.  If you like a very light fluffy flavor this is for you, but if your like me, and like an intense flavor, but highly even syrup which isn't thick, this won't do, hence the 3 star rating.  I would boil this down possibly to a third or less adding sweetner to it,  On a budget its ok, I would add salt, maybe cinnamon, and a pinch of van extract to it, or even stevia to the bottle.  With that said when you buy syrup, it should work out of the bottle, this does not work for me."

There's something about including a cooking pan with the mix that kind of suggests that it's a one-step mix and bake solution. This is NOT a one-step mix, and the fact that they did NOT include the baking instruction picture (back of the package) makes me wonder if it was omitted on purpose. No worries ... if you're reading this review, you will see that I am including a pic.\n\nThis product costs twice what a full-size cake mix costs, and I thought that I was paying the extra charge so I could be lazy, add water, and squeeze on some icing after the mix was baked. Nope, nope, nope. I had to add 3/4 of a stick of butter and an egg, and electric mix two separate packages. The cake mix is powder which needs softened butter and an egg, and the icing is also powder which needs twice as much mixed/whipped butter. I'm not saying that this is super hard: rather that it's kind of silly to pay twice the price of a regular mix to only end up doing the same work and end up with only a 6-inch round cake. I do NOT recommend this product."

I assumed it contained body wash, shampoo and conditioner, and a face scrub.  Most products that advertise 3-in-1 contain shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  AXE has several 3-in-1 hygiene products of this nature and they are excellent.  I normally don't use a facial scrub in the shower.  In the morning, I use a facial scrub before I shave and I always shave before showering.  I need a conditioner.  Without one, I will develop dandruff in a few weeks.\n\n  Life is much easier when ones shampoo and conditioner are together in one bottle.  It is even easier when body wash, shampoo, and conditioner are all together in one bottle.  This is much more convenient when traveling.  One doesnt have to pack so many bottles.  I called the consumer number that is printed on the bottle of Irish Spring Signature for Men 3-in-1; a friendly lady put me on hold while she did some research for me.  She verified that Irish Spring Signature for Men 3-in-1 DOES NOT CONTAIN CONDITIONER.  I suspected as much but I wanted to get my facts correct before writing my review.  In order to prevent confusion, Irish Spring should state something like 3-IN-1 SHAMPOO+BODY WASH+FACE SCRUB.  Also, most body washes I use are appropriate for my entire physique, which includes my face.\n\n  Irish Spring Signature for Men 3-in-1, as it stands, is a good product.  I love its fresh, masculine mint scent.  The shampoo and body wash lather well and easily rinse off my body, leaving me feeling clean.  The bottle is easy to handle; it doesnt slip out of my hand.  If you don't need a hair conditioner, then I highly recommend this product.  If you need one, then you should look at another hygiene product.

The cheese between each cracker is definitely not real cheese, it's more of that artificial cheese stuff but it tastes so good.  I have to avoid these kinds of foods so I can stay somewhat healthy but it's a nice pick me up on occasion."

The very first one I ate when I opened the package got a response of these are umm....interesting! I was missing that great Cheez-It flavor. I couldn't figure out what was wrong so the second one I took it apart. The cheese filling on these are great! It's creamy and delicious and has a good cheddar cheese flavor. The problems comes in, in that this creamy cheesey goodness is supposed to be between two great tasting Cheez-It crackers that I have come to know and love. I'm not sure what happened with these, but that Cheez-It deliciousness is just not there. Even the texture of these crackers are way different. Maybe there were trying to improve on what is already a delicious cracker? Cheese-It folks keep the original delicious cracker we all know and love, just make them bigger and these will be fantastic."
