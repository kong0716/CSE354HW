"189","3","","B003KSBQFC","c7577bb4dac548a143da09ac7c93f04dDCRX","Last May, I discovered Tenth Avenue North's debut and fell in love with their encouraging lyrics and fun music.  I've been looking forward to their follow up, The Light Meets The Dark.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't live up to their debut.\n\nWith this release, Tenth Avenue North has firmly established themselves on the pop side of the pop/rock genre.  In fact, I would be hard pressed to call any of the songs on this disc as rock.  There are some upbeat tracks, but for the most part, things pretty much seem to be on an even keel.  And that's my biggest problem with this disc.  The songs all start to sound the same after a while.\n\nThe lyrics on the first disc were moving and inspirational.  Here, they don't seem quite as deep, even bordering on cliche.  That's even worse to me since the lyrics are usually what make or break a release for me.\n\nThere are some good tracks here.  For example, disc opener ""Healing Begins"" is a nice mid-tempo number that reminds us that we won't truly heal until we accept God's forgiveness.  The verses talk about how all our trying won't do any good.  It starts out rather quiet and slow, but it picks up in both volumn and tempo when they reach the first chorus.  You can even hear some strings in the midst of the guitar and drums.  It really does give me a sense of freedom to remember that God knows my faults and has forgiven them.\n\nThey up the tempo with the next track, ""Strong Enough to Save.""  This track is on the rock side of the spectrum, especially on the chorus, with the loud guitar and strong drum beat.  It follows up the theme of the first track by reminding us that the God who controls nature is strong enough to save us.\n\n""The Trust is Who You Are"" uses guitar to remind us that our belief in God needs to actually affect how we live.  Once again, we've got a guitar driven song that starts slow and builds to mid-tempo by the chorus.\n\nAnother favorite track is the disc closer.  ""Oh My Dear"" is a piano driven ballad.  The longest track here, it's absolutely beautiful to listen to.  The lyrics are pretty powerful as well.  They're written from the point of view of a person who goes over to help a friend who is going through a very rough patch, mainly due to sins of the past.  The forgiveness and love shown are convicting and heartwarming at the same time.\n\nThere are a couple songs that I find annoying because of the lyrics.  ""On and On"" is written from God's point of view as He reminds us of His love and sacrifice for us.  It's got a great piano and strings background that is pretty.  It's an upbeat ballad that could really deliver a powerful wallop.  Yet it leaves me feeling cold because the lyrics cover ground they've done better in other songs on their two discs.\n\nThen there's ""House of Mirrors.""  And upbeat guitar track, it challenges us to break the mirror of our pasts and focus on what God has done for us.  Again, it's something they've covered before and the chorus is just so simple.  I've heard prediction it will be a concert favorite, and I think that will be the case because the simple chorus will be easy to shout out, but it doesn't make for a good song on a CD.\n\nFrankly, this is one of those discs I think I will enjoy best in bits and pieces.  The songs are okay by themselves, so as they come through iTunes shuffle or some such program, I will enjoy hearing them.  But when I sit down and listen to them back to back, I find them lyrically and musically repetitive.\n\nI really did want to like The Light Meets The Dark.  Tenth Avenue North has a gift for putting familiar truths into fresh, encouraging packages.  But the repetitive nature of the songs here makes it only average."

So much so, that this album could bookend any of the ones that they put out in the early 1980s and it would sound, and feel, perfectly right.\n\nThis CD truly is electro-pop bliss! Many catchy songs, and a few that could inspire you to hit the dance floor, but OMD also still have that a darker, creative edge that colors other tunes. But rest assured, when these guys want to write songs with hooks, they know how to do it, and they still are doing it very well. A great sounding return to form."

Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter."

Firstly it expands her repertoire considerably and presumably her live shows will be able to be more fleshed out. Secondly this album has her showing a bit more restraint in terms of the guitar solos and she also uses more of a whispering vocal style in parts which is different if not actually a good thing.\n\nObviously when you come out of the blocks with a debut as good as Ms Taylor did the follow up won't hit people as hard and this album doesn't. But it has a danker feel of grit to it than the aforementioned debut and that isn't a bad thing. Issues arise however with the whispering vocals that fade into obscurity at times, songs that just don't sparkle like those of the debut and the guitar tones sought here seem obtusely thicker without necessarily obtaining extra gravitas as part of the deal.\n\nHighlights on this album would have to be the slow starting first track, Can't Keep Living Like This, Dead and Gone and the title track. Dead and Gone in particular sounds like it would be out of place on the first tune with the guitar and vocal riding a melody that is both plaintive and upbeat at the same time with a tasty fade out solo."

"1882","5","","B004GKI7AU","c7577bb4dac548a143da09ac7c93f04dDCRX","When I picked up Brandon Heath's third project, I was expecting something hard hitting about the realities of life.  What else would you expect from a disc entitled Leaving Eden?  While Brandon does touch on that some, he spends most of the time focusing on God, His love for us, and how we can make a difference in the world around us.\n\nThe disc opens with ""Leaving Eden,"" and it is the one song on the disc that does talk about how hard life can be.  Over the course of the verses, he mentioned Alzheimer's, a Salvation Army store being robbed, natural disaster, and war.  Yeah, real upbeat stuff.  So it is actually a surprise that the song is on the fast side of mid-tempo with a soaring melody that makes it much less depressing then you think it would be.\n\nBut Brandon immediately changes focus with the second track.  ""Your Love"" is the first single from the disc, and it's a winner.  It's at once a song of praise and surrender to God for His great love for us.  Again, it's on the mid-tempo side of things with a melody that is very catchy.  This one will be very popular on the radio.\n\nActually, God's love and care for us are the theme of several of the other songs on this disc.  ""It's Alright"" is a piano and string based ballad that uses images from Jesus' life to remind us He always have things under control.  ""Stolen,"" one of my favorites on this disc, talks about God's relentless pursuit of those He calls His own.  And for pure fun, there's ""Might Just Save Your Life.""  This song is written from God's point of view as He rescues someone who was in a desperate situation.  This song is pure rock with a tad of hip hop thrown in.  Frankly, it reminds me most of ""Give Me Your Eyes"" from his last CD.\n\nThe other theme on the disc is how we are to respond to the world around us as a result of knowing God's love.  The theme is introduced early in ""The Light in Me,"" but it really starts to be driven home at the end of the disc.  ""It's No Good to be Alone"" is written to a friend who has withdrawn from life.  Verse one sounds like someone hiding due to depression while verse two is someone so busy perusing a dream they lose track of everyone around them.  The chorus is a tad on the repetitive side as it repeats the title several times, but the fun melody always makes me forget that fact.  In fact, this is the song I am most likely to find myself humming after I listen to the disc.\n\n""The One"" goes beyond our friends to look at those struggling around us.  But it doesn't end with the verses detailing the hardships around us.  The chorus is a call to action.  ""If it takes just one, just one/What if, what if, what if I'm the one.""\n\nThe final track looks forward to the hope of Heaven.  ""As Long as I'm Here"" is a slow ballad that dreams of how great the day will be when we can return to Eden.  While he doesn't quite put it that bluntly, it certainly does bring the disc full circle.\n\nStylistically, Brandon is still in the mostly guitar driven pop/rock he's done so well on his first two discs.  There isn't too much new to his sound, but his fans will certainly be happy with what they hear.\n\nLeaving Eden might not be a huge step forward musically for Brandon Heath, but the songs here are still great.  His many fans will be pleased with it and it might just win him some new ones as well."

If you like to take long slow walks, don't listen to this track.  However, if you REALLY want to move, you Got to Be Real and let it go!"

True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.\n\nI am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this."

"2696","4","","B0041Q5YJ6","a45c12552902da6b583215beb62686f8MB6L","Good album.  The first half of the album didn't generate as much interest for me as did the last half which I found to be more engaging and interesting.  A nice bit of diversity and some flourish there, from the driving rocker ""To the Wolves"" to the acoustically oriented and affective ""Down"".  Album ender ""Depraved"" is their most adventurous song, and their longest, but it pales in comparison to some of their other last tracks.\n\nThis is most definitely a ""poppier"" Anberlin.  They're moving far away from their new wave punk influences (though they are still there in tracks like ""We Owe This To Ourselves"") and toward emotionally swooning ballads (like ""Take Me As You Found Me"").  Fans of their first three albums might have a hard time with this one.  Me?  I like the catchy nuances and production found here."
"2697","4","","B0041Q5YJ6","c68bd177eec6a0c78a96e720c74098740XGQ","I've been a fan of Anberlin since Never Take Friendship Personal came out. I heard of them through a friend of a friend, and at the time I was going through an indie splurge at the time so I listened to them right away. The music was fantastic, and I quickly recommended them to other friends. Sure enough, the fire caught on quickly and most of my friends were fans.\nBut then Cities came out and totally wiped their previous albums clean. They're both good, and I have some friends who still prefer the second out of pure nostalgia, but Cities as a whole was far above their previous work.\n\nSo how could they possibly top that?\n\nAnswer: they can't. Once you go above and beyond something fans will always compare your next work to what they consider your best. It's just simple habit.\nNow, Dark Is the Way is by no means bad; in fact, it's very good. It just doesn't capture the energy or detailed lyricism as their previous albums (namely Cities, of course).\n\nI have to emphasize that this is still a very good album, and ""Pray Tell"" is one of my favorite Anberlin titles from all their works.\nYou get more varied sounds here, noted by Anberlin's curiosity in incorporating different tunes and styles in their forte. Some work, some don't (but are still good), and the end result is a mixture of the very good to the okay."

I bought several of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections a few years back shortly after our son was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  An OT recommended The Listening Program, but my little man doesn't do headphones.  And everything I looked at study wise on that seemed to be mixed, with some studies indicating that listening to plain classical music alone would produce similar benefits.  So I purchased these to play quietly in the background as we did other things.  Of all of the collections we got, he tolerates Mozart the longest.  I always knew that kid of mine had great taste ;)  The thing that to me is the stand out thing about this product is how many tracks you get for the price, and the quality if fine for what we were using it for."

However, I didn't buy this for me.  It is part of a group of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections that I purchased for my son's sensory integration therapy. They aren't able to get him to wear headphones for the Auditory Integration Therapy at his occupational therapy clinic, and some studies have indicated the listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits, so I purchased this along with several others. So, while I have another version of the ""Messiah"" in particular that I prefer to this,  I feel like this has met the need for which it was purchased, and I'm a huge fan of the price point."

So it's a great thing I didn't buy this for me.  This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" collections we purchased for our son's sensory integration therapy.  And this was a great value for the number of pieces on it, and that's the reason for the five stars.  Sadly, I find myself being glad that this is one he frequently can't wait to get turned off."
"4517","5","","B005W29340","c405bfca652659395d40f0fa169bb4d8KWRN","This is one where I'm rating it pretty much based on value.  This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks."

Because of the strength of his reactions to things, sometimes I find myself needing to find middle ground no matter how much I admire and respect the therapists who work with him and their recommendations.  Many OT clinics like to do The Listening Program with sensory processing disorder or Autistic kiddos, and our little man does *not* do headphones.  We've been working on it, working on it, working on it...and we have brief periods of time where he will tolerate it, and most of the time he either rips them off his head or gets agitated at the mere sight.  So in looking at the studies on The Listening Program and AIT therapy in general, some of the information indicates that listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits.  So I purchased a whole bunch of these because the price point was great and they were digital and I could access them from multiple devices.  This is the other collection my son will listen to for a longer period of time then the others.  He prefers the Mozart one, but he'll get through more of this one before requesting it be turned off then he will the remainder of them."

Again, this is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son, who has a deeply entrenched dislike of headphones.  Actually, that's an oversimplification.  It would be more accurate to say that they feel radically different on his head then they would to you or I and he  still can't tolerate that sensation well most of the time, and there's probably a sensitivity to sound component in there as well.  Usually the best we can get is for him to allow them around his neck for a short period of time while one of his favorite movies plays on my kindle.  Music generally is too unmotivating to even get him to try and deal with the headphones from his perspective.  Since the type of Auditory Integration Therapy used by my son's OT clinic uses headphones, we've been kind of dying on that hill, but some of the studies into the efficacy of this method for treating sensory issues have indicated that traditional, unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits.  So we purchased these a while back as a work around it, trying to still get the job done kind of solution and have been quite satisfied with them.  The price point is awesome, which given that we pour money like crazy on therapeutic supports for our son, I am a big, big fan of."

I still think there are few too many lulls and slow moments, but in an odd way that sort of adds to the vibe of the whole album. But the highs and sweet spots on here are very good.

"5322","5","","B002PYCAKM","77c2b00b535a3b5085155d712c114627NM7B","""Celebration"" is one of Madonna's most danceable and fastest moving songs in years. I cannot remember the last song that I heard that I enjoyed as much. Like the title says, it really is a celebration. Every time I listen to this song I get the feeling that I heard it before. It reminds me of a hybrid of about half a dozen different Madonna songs, such as ""Music"" ""Into The Groove"" ""Holiday"" ""Everybody"" ""Spotlight"" and even ""Erotica."" It's just so inviting and fun. My favorite part is when Madonna laughs because she has such an honest laughter that is so real and genuine. ""Celebration"" is for both old and newschool fans because the Queen of Pop mixes both the creative and the created like the master artist that she is now famed for. Every time I listen to this song all different images of Madonna over the years flash in my mind, it's like Madonna's life story in 3 minutes set to music. This is the very first MP3 that I ever downloaded, I feel so old. But Madonna is well worth it. For someone who grew up listening to her on compact cassettes this is an entirely new experience but who else can change with the best of em like Madonna."

I wanted that song in my collection and hoped that I would find more of the same.  Well, I both did and didnt.  I did because there is a bounty of worship none of which I was familiar with but I didn't because I didn't find any other song that generated the same type of emotional or worshipful connection that I Surrender did.  Im not terribly into worship music and don't like a lot of it so when I find something that I resonate so strongly with I end up having high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed but sometimes I found myself having to work at being engaged.  I do think that the albums last two tracks, Greater Than All with its crescendoing force and a studio version of Hope of the World with an upfront piano line and steady rhythm, are very good worship songs.  Vocalists vary and include both men and women leads.  There are some other tracks on here that are moving or that I just enjoy (the production is such that the live experience is muted and it really sounds more like a studio album with background shouts and choral voices and echoes tracked down) and I was surprised at how long Hillsong has been doing this and it being commercially available.  Personally I don't know that I will go out and purchase another Hillsong Live disc but at least they're on my radar."

Hey, some songs I never head by the likes of favorites such Graham Parker, Lindsey Buckingham, and Ryan Adams. I'll take that!\n\nFortunately, those songs and most of the other ones on this soundtrack were very good. A most worthwhile purchase. The 3 Buckingham tracks, especially the radiant ""Brother & Sister"" are top-notch tunes. The tunes by Graham Parker are also very good with ""What Do You Like?"" being the standout track. The songs by Paul Simon, Loudon Wainwright III, Ryan Adams, Wilco, and the Avett Brothers are also very strong ones. Really, the only tracks I don't care for are the ones by Yoko Ono and Fiona Apple. Take away those two blemishes and you have yourself an outstanding collection of music."

From being shackled to a caffle of slaves on the way to be sold to being rescued by a dentist who turned out to be his best friend and who helped him rescue his wife from the tyrant that had her enslaved. Meanwhile there was the music that went along with Django and one of the songs was "":Freedom"" and it was hauntingly beautiful and made a great movie even better.

"8298","4","","B00AXVGU6O","cb952e3708973059dd0d99d2e5879e55OVFK","This was my first Toro Y Moi album, the purchase prompted after hearing two most excellent songs (one of which, ""Say That,"" is on this album) on some compilation discs (one from Mojo Magazine, and the other part of the ""Late Night Tales"" CD series). Anyway, I was so impressed by those two songs that when I found this CD at a shop in Kuala Lumpur recently I didn't hesitate to take the plunge. About two dozen listens later I'm hooked!\n\nLike many other reviewers, I'm both captivated by this guy's music (and Toro Y Moi is indeed one guy: Chas Bundick), and also unable to categorize it, at least not easily. Toro Y Moi straddles musical borders, hops across them, and integrates a variety of styles into his songs. The closest artist that he compares to, in my opinion, is Todd Rundgren. In fact, if Todd was 30 years younger, he might be making similar music as Toro Y Moi. Both artists are virtually one-man bands, able to produce, write, sing and perform their music in a seemingly effortless fashion ... and turn your head around in process. They both share an uncanny ability to write catchy pop songs with very soulful undercurrents. The biggest difference between the two, aside from the obvious gap in ages, is that some of Rundgren's song veer off into a rockier direction, while Bundick mines a funkier musical vein. But each guy qualifies as a musical wizard who knows how to optimize his use of a recording studio.\n\nAs much as I like this Tory Y Moi album, there are a few tracks that don't quite dazzle or sustain interest. But even when it doesn't all click, you have to admire the effort. I think this guy is an incredible talent and capable of delivering a true masterpiece of an album. And that may be coming very, very soon. I'll be eagerly waiting."

Ms. Veirs is definitely not resting\non her laurels and hopefully will continue to evolve into deeper territory.\nIn my humble estimation she is one of the top songwriters working today,\nshe deserves more recognition.\nLaura Veirs, Laura Marling, Courtney Barnette, Angel Olsen, Valerie June,\nCold Specks, Marissa Nadler, etc.--the women are tearing it up!"

The categories are even more varied if you count the second release which includes contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You) and some old school 80s rock (Phil Collins In the Air Tonight).  There are ten songs over two releases and this first release accounts for six of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.  My favorite of this lot would be their cover of Metallicas Nothing Else Matters wherein Smith soars to add that emotional punch right at the right moment."

I often prefer to be doing something active, but when all sorts of craziness is going on, I like to nurture myself with music I love.  And it's been raining crazy over here for weeks, and today was no exception.  And our little man has been in the CD's of late, and let's just say things will never be the same with our collection and probably the sooner we go digital the better, so I bought myself this album as a treat for myself.  Because Heaven only knows where the CD is at this point.\n\nSo, I have loved Loreena Mckinnett for years, and this album is another one of my long standing favorites.  She has a beautiful, ethereal voice.  Her music is evocative and passionate and soothing all at the same time.  I love the infusion of poetry in her lyrics. I haven't heard a single thing of hers I haven't loved.  So no deep reasons for this rating, just I love what I love, and I really love this album."

For some reason they decided to split up their Acoustic Sessions into two parts and the first entry  is even more diversified but if I had to pick a favorite between the two I would go with this second, shorter session due to the strength of the Adele coververy moving and strong and I don't even listen to Adele; does anyone else want to see these two maybe perform a duet?and PJs impassioned tune.  I was surprised that my least favorite track was the one I anticipated being my favorite as I have always really enjoyed the slow-burn power of In the Air Tonight but with the percussion and in spite of their best efforts to provide that rising punch its just not there.  There are ten songs over the two releases and this second release accounts for four of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward."

At times it reminds me of a song that could have been scored for a James Bond movie.  The vocals are kind of similar to Adele.

You wouldn't be crazy if you thought this song was a new track from Adele.  Singer Kristianne Bautista has a vaguely souful voice and the backing track sounds similar to Adele's ""Skyfall"".

He finally released Definitely Now and the lead single ""On My Mind"".  The song is a slow grinder with a super chunky guitar riff.

And he candidly crafts a song that questions whether or not he has the surefire approach to it all.  Is he scared of the acclaim, has he not been a forthcoming as a disciple of Christ?  Will he hear Jesus say to him ""Well done my good and faithful servant""?  In the song ""Fear"" he carefully weighs those options, and the bass, keys, drums acoustic guitar to the multilingual translation of Psalm 23 are a introspective look at Lecrae's understanding.  And Natalie Lauren's beautiful voice offers encouraging advice to Lecrae's verses to be unafraid.  As people of God we know that the fear of men is a snare, But the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.  Great song, Lecrae!"

Kates distinct vocals are front and center on every track and in no way are overshadowed by the modern production, which while quite layered, never comes across as too busy or overproduced, a rarity these days. The arrangements are unusual but catchy as hell and the lyrics are original and clever, which means youll never hear any of these on the radio, ha-ha. Full lyrics are included in the liner notes too, which is much appreciated.\n\nMy favorites include the dynamic opening ode to self-empowerment THROWING DOWN THE ROSES, the irresistible stomper MISTER SISTER that captures the pain of struggle of the transgender experience in only two verses and earworm chorus and BOTTOMS UP, which is the perfect song for cruising with the top down on a weekend afternoon, but each song here has its own unique charms (although I am not that crazy about the final depressing number PULLS YOU UNDER which prevents me from rating this 5 Stars)."

My husband and I were talking about my two pairs of pants I bought this week for church, and I told him I was totally going for the more pant like set first because darn it, I've read the scriptures (read them daily even) and there's nowhere in them that says ""Woman, thou shalt only wear skirts to church.""  But it's become such an ingrained part of the social metaphorical yardstick of faithfulness people like to measure you against in our church that despite what people see me doing every week with our son, it's going to be seen as scandalous to the point of heresy by some when I show up this Sunday...and I don't think it should be that way.  I think we should just love people, because loving them works a lot better and feels a lot better then judging them. But that's just my opinion on the subject.\n\nAnd probably most people won't say anything to my face, but experience has taught me the rat-a-tat-tat of the firing squad will probably be making the rounds behind my back.  And as we were talking about this, my husband said, ""So you're like the color of boom.""  And I said, ""Que?"" because I'd totally never heard this song, and then I quipped, ""no, I'm more like the color of ka-boom""  As in fireworks, because I'm not just loud, I'm also glittery and sparkly all at the same time ;)  And he said, no babe, you totally have to listen to this song (because he'd had it on prime music on his phone) because this sounds like you...and I just laughed as I listened, because he's totally right.  And then I bought the song.\n\nI realize the lyrics can have some different interpretations, but I think it also speaks a lot towards people who feel like they might just be out of sync with the people around them because maybe they're the neon color in the box of primary and secondary colored crayons.  Or the one with glitter and sparkles. And maybe like me, they have trouble coloring in the lines, but their heart is in the best possible places, right?  So I love this song, totally love it, and it made my day better.  And I'm going to be struggling to be singing hymns in my head and not this song when I walk through the doors on Sunday.  But I'll try to be good, because I usually do, in the biblical sense anyways ;)"

This unique arrangement is, I believe, by Brent Fischer - the son of the legendary composer/music director/arranger Mr. Clare Fischer. Both Fischers worked closely with Prince for several years. (And you can hear the Prince influence in several of D'Angelo's works.)"

One of the best albums of the year? Frankly, I was wary. Too many times all the positive hype ends up in me being disappointed. Not so in this case; Ryley Walker is the real deal and this album is a delight!\n\nIf you've read the other reviews, you pretty know much know what to expect. There are a couple of songs that remind me a bit of vintage Nick Drake, but for the most part this sounds a lot like John Martyn during his ""Solid Air"" period. In fact, there is one song on here that sounds so much like ""Real World"" that I thought it was a cover version at first. But as another reviewer suggested, sounding like Martyn is far from a bad thing, and Ryley Walker is not some sort of unimaginative copycat. His guitar playing skills are very impressive, his vocals are pleasing, and he also has a flair for penning intelligent lyrics. What more can you say? This guy is indeed the total package and I'm excited to have discovered him."

Nominate anyone else you want to, but Im gonna declare DBT the winners anyway. Theyve been through several lineup shuffles over the past decade or so, but the band does indeed keep on truckin, thanks to the outstanding songs of Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. and their unabashed love of playing music\n\nThis 3-CD set, culled from recent live shows, the band in top form. Factor in their deft musical chops (including some very impressive guitar playing), Hoods sometimes funny and often passionate between-song story-telling, and some fierce versions of many of their best-known songs, and you have a powerful live album. If you're a DBT fan, this is a must have. Life affirming music."

"18248","4","","B014CJFN92","a45c12552902da6b583215beb62686f8MB6L","Im going to start off by saying that I was underwhelmed by Part I.  It lacked a visceral quality; it was very symphonic but it lacked punch and exciting flourish.  Part II is more of the same, but it is better (I think).  While still very symphonic it also puts more emphasis into its punch, its bite.  The guitar work is more present (or at least more obvious to my ears) and a lot more driving than in Part I.  But I discovered a curious thing while listening through the album several times.  When I listened to the album as a whole I thought it was okay to good but still not really great.  Maybe there still wasn't enough distinctiveness between the songs for me to hang my standout moments or tracks on, or maybe the songs blurred together too much.  Whatever it was I still came away from the experiences not feeling fulfilled or whatever I was looking to feel by this release.  But when I listened to the release song by song, focusing on each song individually instead of part of the whole, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this album a whole lot more.  Godmakers Temptation is a classic VP sound, an engaging track, and part of the first half of this release.  The following song Stone Roses Edge breaks into a gallop early on with some delicious guitars and nice keys surrounding them and filling them out, a heavy beat upping the intensity.  The first half of this release is pretty solid in fact.  Where I found myself losing interest or felt that the songs lost either energy or had an unfortunate blending was toward the end of the release.  And I think thats why this was so hard for me to really get into, because the first track (vision eleven as part of the Chronicles story) didn't immediately grab but the following three or four tacks did and then there were about three where the car slowed down before ending pretty well.  Symphonic metal fans, metal fans who like large religiously-tinged fantasy stories, and I suppose VD fans all will be satiated by Netherworld Part II.  For me, I will hope that they strip their sound down at points, and separate their flourishes on their next outing.  3.75 stars."

Echoes of Gram and Emmylou indeed! I've enjoyed other albums by Teddy Thompson in the past, but this could be the best thing he's done yet. These two singers are a perfect musical fit.\n\nBut darn it, why couldn't they have given us an extra song or two? This is much too short. I still shudder at the thought of spending so much money for only 25 minutes of music. That makes this more an EP than a proper album. I shouldn't complain too loudly; the songs here are truly first-rate, but it's not exactly value for the money. Is there a reason that it's not being sold at a much cheaper price?"

There are some great tunes here and this collection plays better than the snooze fest that was found on the AT LAST CD.\n\nFUNNEL OF LOVE has Cyndis trademark vocal tics and hiccups and they work wonderfully in this context.\n\nDETOUR sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s by Kitty Wells.\n\nMISTY BLUE is a dynamic vocal performance, period. This and HARD CANDY CHRISTMAS are probably the best ones on the CD.\n\nWALKNG AFTER MIDNIGHT is one of the weak links only because no one can sing this like Patsy Cline and the arrangement isn't as atmospheric as the original; the lack of male backup is detrimental. I FALL TO PIECES works much better even though its a carbon-copy version of Patsys.\n\nHEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER has a vocal that is typical Cyndi and an average arrangement.\n\nEND OF THE WORLD is less cringe-worthy than the syrupy Skeeter Davis version.\n\nYOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY with Vince Gill is a cute duet with lots of funny banter and it works better than the drowsy Willie Nelson duet on the country-blues number NIGHT LIFE.\n\nI WANNA BE A COWBOYS SWEETHEART is noteworthy for the yodeling if nothing else."

"19281","4","","B01BFVFHNC","cb952e3708973059dd0d99d2e5879e55OVFK","Another good but inconsistent album by Parquet Courts that leaves me a bit frustrated. There are times when this band sounds great, like a top notch outfit, but at other times, they slip into mediocrity and frustrate me.\n\nMost of the other reviews give you a good gist of what this band sounds like. You can hear plenty of Velvet Underground influence, a bit of Pavement, and I also hear a healthy dose of old Dream Syndicate in some songs. Obviously, those are some very good influences. But Parquet Courts also have this maddening tendency to talk-rap in some of the songs, as if they are just too lazy to actually sing the song. The lead singer has a decent enough voice, so I don't know why they do this so often. Other than those infrequent musical hiccups, there are some powerful, riveting songs on this latest effort. I'm just waiting for this band to really show what they are capable of and give us a truly great album. This isn't quite the one."
