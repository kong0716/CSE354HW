"49","4","2","B011O2R9LU","3a85d5b629f82a0af66912fb2e4bacfdRHIU","Effective with a pleasant scent!  We had used the ""blue"" toilet treatment from West Marine for years, but found it be a bit pricey when not on sale.  We switched to an ""orange"" RV and marine tank treatment that we found at Walmart and it was just bad.  That scent actually made the odor worse - almost skunky- and the orange color mixed with the toilet water was not a pleasant sight.  I found this Rid-X treatment and gave it a whirl.  Sometimes we plan on pumping out, but schedule, weather and water conditions to get to the pump dock prevent us from doing so and the dirty holding tank has to sit for up to 2 weeks on occasion.  This treatment has been very effective at keeping odor at bay until the next pump out.  A little seems to go a long way in stinky boat toilet prevention!"

My opinion is that companies are radically reducing the pricey flavor of items and adding sodium or sweeteners to mask the loss. In this case sugar.\nThe taste can be pretty good and somewhat realistic if you adjust the quantities of water and mix.\nEnjoy within Twenty Four Hours of mixing for best flavor.

This particular one was a very good value on Prime Pantry as well as being low in calories and quite appealing to the taste buds.  What else could you want in a soup or any food for that matter.  Another thing that I love about Progresso Soups is the great variety that they offer, and unlike other brands, they all do not taste the same.  Each has a distinctly different taste.  Prime Pantry still needs to find a way to ship them without damaging the cans so badly.  Other than that, I highly recommend the soup and the supplier."

This is a great way to liven up the flavor.  I have friends who take cinnamon each day because some say it's supposed to help regulate blood sugar.  I also read that in the book 4 Hour Body which is where I first heard about it. This is a good way to get that cinnamon and enjoy it with a little extra. I currently eat Apple and Cinnamon oatmeal but it would just be too much to put it on that. Next time I'm going to purchase plain because I think this will be just the right flavor for that."

So what I do is look at the directions and improve the end results! So it says, basically through in everything and 2tbs water. So what I did was take ingredients except for sauce. And use chicken stock. Then while this was in the microwave for a minute. I sprinkled some toasted sesame seeds. And added chopped basil. Put it back in. Flip it. Add some more seeds. Take it out. Add the sauce. Mix it generally. The only thing that could use for improvement would be the noodles. They had a fantastic texture and taste. But I believe they where a bit broken.

If you ask me, I would say it was a three star product.  So I'm putting it in the middle.\n\nSo let's go with her reasoning first:  It tastes good and has a great texture.  I agree with those points.  So next up is my reasoning, and this is where you can think of me as being kind of like the female version of one of Kronk's angels from The Emperor's New Groove.  I'll let you decide which one.\n\nSo while I think this has a decent protein amount, it uses Maltitol as a sweetener.  Maltitol is a sugar alcohol that can lead to gastro intestinal upset, loose stools, and a whole bunch of gaseous emissions from your backside. If all you have with Maltitol or any other sugar alcohol is one of these a day, you will probably avoid the worst of that.  But if you're consuming other products with sugar alcohols in them as well, that's a heads up.  Second up is that this has no fiber in it whatsoever.  For me personally, I prefer protein bars that also have fiber in them.  It's beneficial for a whole bunch of health reasons: stabilizing blood sugar, healthy bowel function, satiation.\n\nAnd, I'm not really sure as I look at the ingredients label what the 9 grams of other carbs are here.  Because there's no fiber listed, and only 13g of sugar alcohol listed, but 24 grams of total carb.  I am also wondering how much vitamin E this contains, because it does list tocopherols as an ingredient, but doesn't list a vitamin E amount on the nutrition label.  Generally, it's not a good idea to go over the recommended daily allowance on Vitamin E supplementation because it can have some pretty negative side effects, so I like to keep my eye on that.  I also think that the calorie count is higher then I personally prefer to see on a protein bar that doesn't have fiber in it.  For my own use, I prefer Julian Bakery's bars, I also like the Kirkland Signature ones from Costco, because they use natural zero calorie, zero glycemic index sweeteners, have lower calorie counts, and much higher fiber, with more natural or shorter lists of ingredients.\n\nSo at this point you're saying, why did you buy these?  Fair enough.  They are the lesser of several evils, and I'm only planning on letting her have a few of these a week. She decided she wanted to become a vegetarian last year, but isn't always as fond of some of the more traditional vegetarian staples.  I prefer her to have the Vega protein shakes (she says they taste like chocolate milk, and I agree with that), which she also likes, but she says those are harder to use at school during her snack times, and I sometimes like to send a protein source in for her there.  So we're using the Vega stuff for home.  I don't think these are the worst thing she or you could use, but I do think there are healthier options out there.  You may have to make some sacrifices in taste and texture to go healthier, but I personally prefer healthier so that is what I do. But my first goal is to make sure she eats enough protein, so I'm willing to meet her in the middle when I need to, because she's not as willing to make sacrifices in taste for a healthier option."

The Meyer Lemon is smaller, more orange-ish in color with a sweeter, less tart flavor than the lemon with an amazing fragrance. As a hot or cold herbal tea it is excellent. However, this is my go to caffeine-free tea for iced tea. Make it with just a little honey and its quite refreshing. But if you want a real treat just add slices of a fresh Meyer Lemon (or a good squeeze from a large piece) and its exponentially better. I like that Stash foil packs their tea bags to keep them super fresh so when you open the pack you will immediately be hit by the fragrance of the Meyer Lemon oil. I've had many different blends of the typical  ""rosehips-lemongrass-hibiscus base"" - but the Meyer Lemon really seems to pair best in my opinion. This is a winner!"
